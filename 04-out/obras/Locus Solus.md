The production of _Locus Solus_ by _Out Of The Box Intermedia_

director 
Sozita Goudouna

[8](https://books.openedition.org/pur/52694?lang=en#ftn8) attempts to understand the juncture between joining and discovery as well as the tension of «what is representing» and «what is represented» by enabling the spectators to see themselves as part of the created situation. The establishment of a singular set of spatial relations between the art objects, the performers and the architectural space is achieved by the inclusion of the beholder in the art work.

13The three different stages/spaces of the performance based installation project _Locus Solus I, II, III_ (2008-2010) reconsidered the work of the proto-surrealist writer and Surrealism’s historical context, along with its literary and pictorial culture, so as to engage with the ways in which a «classic» text like _Locus solus_ can comment on the notion of the «total work of art[9](https://books.openedition.org/pur/52694?lang=en#ftn9) » and on the implications of new technologies and practices that challenge received notions about the theatrical event and about the art object and its representation. The scenographic approach in _Locus Solus_ examines points of intersection between theatre and installation art, in a structure that is interpreted as a version of «scenodynamic architecture», namely, an «architectural» construction, that attempts to embody the ways in which the «total artwork» is expressed through a synthetic relationship between sound, colour, form and movement. A «responsive environment» based on a more external plastic and dimensional paradigm, as a kind of flexible performance environment that accommodates the project’s vision. Contemporary technologically responsive environments have been entangled with performance across a wide range of disciplines, hence, the production’s scenographic and architectural practices concentrate on the experiential, three-dimensionality of performance space rather than the representational aspects of its visual image.

14Parallel to this, the project addresses a general strategy in collaborative practice that engages participants in the work, by shifting the meaning of the art object to the experience that is made with and through this work. The focus on individual artistic practice, the experience of the artistic process and the attitude of the creative act are some of the guiding principles that inform the expanded and unbounded relationship between space, subjecthood and artwork.

15The project engaged with the use of new media, sound and performance, including work that is process-driven, participatory and interactive. The artworks and performances involve a variety of time-based media, hybrid, intermedia forms and expanded modes of display beyond the museum or the theatre. Roussel’s early fascination with human machine entanglements, fantastic hybrids of nature and technology, bodies and machines; machines which produce living beings and living things; organic matter integrated in machines and the construction of hyperreal landscapes, is identified with practices that involve intermedia and hybrid forms of art production.

16Intermediality is examined as a radical force that operates in-between realities and that involves new modes of representation and collaboration, new dramaturgical strategies, new ways of creating temporal and spatial interrelations, both in artistic venues and public spaces. Intermedia art practice involves a combinatory structure of syntactical elements that come from more than one medium but are combined into one and are thereby transformed into a new entity. The reference frame of the entire system of art forms that mediates the intermedial correlation is itself included in the processes of transformation. This approach highlights the dialectic between the media that is not reliant only on technology, as it is often believed, however, technology often provides with more possibilities for exploring the potentials and limits of every art medium.

17_Locus Solus_ attempts to integrate different mediums into an intermedial correlation that encounters the entangled relationship between live performance and installation art and between performers and art works. The stage is designed as a machine that utilizes the technologies of time and space and media in creating an affective responsive experience for the audience. _Locus Solus_ is staged as a labyrinthine installation, an entity with many discrete parts, of stages within stages, and of events within events, that generates critical «points of view», concerning scenographic, visual and theatrical practice. The project deploys a scenographic and a dramaturgical model based on an analogy between the central character’s laboratories and a museum (a cabinet of curiosities). The laboratories with the ingenious inventions represent gallery rooms, where visual artists exhibit their work.
