The artwork ‘Very Nervous System’ (1986-1990) by David Rokeby is an early example of an interactive sound installation where body movement in open space generates sound. However, the sound of such artworks and instruments like the Theremin usually does not appear to originate from the location of the movement, which is a key difference from sonically tangible objects. Furthermore, with few exceptions, they do not (try to) express the presence of virtual objects in space.
