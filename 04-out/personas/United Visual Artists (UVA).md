United Visual Artists (UVA) is a London based practice founded in 2003 by British artist Matt Clark. UVA’s diverse body of work integrates new technologies with traditional media, such as sculpture, performance and site-specific installation.

Drawing from sources ranging from ancient philosophy to theoretical science, the practice explores the cultural frameworks and natural phenomena that shape our cognition, creating instruments that manipulate our perception and expose the relativity of our experiences. Rather than material objects, UVA’s works are better understood as events in time, in which the performance of light, sound and movement unfolds.

UVA has been commissioned internationally by institutions including the Barbican Curve Gallery, London; Manchester International Festival; Royal Academy of Arts; Serpentine Gallery, London; The Wellcome Trust; Victoria & Albert Museum; YCAM, Tokyo, Japan and the Biennale of Sydney, amongst others.

The studio’s work is collected by the Fondation Cartier pour l’art contemporain, France and MONA, Australia. UVA has staged solo shows at Bitforms Gallery and has been selected for several group exhibitions including at Blain|Southern and Riflemaker galleries, London; Bryce Wolkowitz, New York; Seoul Museum of Art, Seoul, Korea; Power Station of Art, Shanghai, China, 180 Strand, London and NXT Museum, Amsterdam. Permanent public works are sited internationally in Toronto, Dubai, Philadelphia and London.

The studio has an open and inclusive approach to collaboration, internally as a team and with specialists outside the practice. Collaborative relationships span arts, culture and the sciences, including with choreographers Animals of Distinction, Benjamin Millepied and the Paris Opéra Ballet, filmmaker Adam Curtis, musicians Massive Attack, Battles, James Blake, Ben Frost, the soundscape ecologist Bernie Krause and cognitive scientist Mark Changizi to name but a few. In 2023 UVA marked its 20th year at 180 Studios with the exhibition ‘UVA: Synchronicity’, the studio’s largest survey show to date.
