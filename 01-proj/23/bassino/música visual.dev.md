### 1930 Eugene Sholpo Leningrad Graphic Sound Laboratory
    
Painted Sound." A technology developed by a group of enthusiasts in the 1930s, long before the invention of sequencers and synthesizers. It allowed for the artificial creation of soundtrack graphics on film to synthesize any sounds, effects, and record complex polyphonic works.

Composer Arseny Avrahamov, designer Evgeny Sholpo, and animation director Mikhail Tsekhanovsky, while working on one of the first Soviet sound films, The Five-Year Plan. The Great Work Plan" came up with the idea of the drawn sound technique. When the first rolls of film were developed, Tsehanovsky, admiring the beauty of the patterns of the sound track, suggested the idea: "I wonder if, if we film an Egyptian or ancient Greek ornament on this track – wouldn’t suddenly sound archaic music unknown to us until now?" Roughly speaking, the idea of "painted sound" developed out of simple human curiosity. It happened in October 1929.
    
The laboratories soon established were the world’s first prototypes of future computer music research centers. Mostly, applied film music was created, the result of the work was the dubbing of films. The most famous works are those of Evgeny Sholpo, the inventor of the Variofon instrument, composer and researcher Arseny Avrahamov, who worked on the problems of ultra-chromatic music, and Nikolai Voinov, who created the Nivoton. In the home-recording era, within the framework of the technique of drawn sound, these researchers attempted to create a technology that is traditionally considered the highest achievement of computer music technology of the 1990s.

    The materials to build Catalina are listed in an internal memo from August 1968, titled
    ‘Urgent USA purchases’ under the subtitle, ‘New Project’. The materials include a
    closed-circuit TV camera (Ampex Vidicon), three Moog units (oscillator, amplifier, and filter
    controlled by voltage), and two sets of Dixon field-effect transistors
