abstract = {"Somos m{\'{a}}quinas de supervivencia, aut{\'{o}}matas programados a ciegas con el fin de perpetuar la existencia de los ego{\'{i}}stas genes que albergamos en nuestras c{\'{e}}lulas." As{\'{i}} de rotundo es el comienzo del libro en el que el et{\'{o}}logo Richard Dawkins populariz{\'{o}} la teor{\'{i}}a de que los genes son las verdaderas «unidades» centrales de la evoluci{\'{o}}n, en vez de los individuos como los animales o las plantas. De esto hace ya casi treinta a{\~{n}}os, pues el libro se public{\'{o}} en 1976. Seg{\'{u}}n Dawkins, los genes primigenios nos crearon a las personas y los animales, quienes somos en realidad meras «m{\'{a}}quinas de transmisi{\'{o}}n». Como m{\'{a}}quinas podemos funcionar mejor o peor en nuestro entorno y de este modo continuar la cadena (garantizar la supervivencia y reproducci{\'{o}}n de los genes) a lo largo del tiempo, o perecer en una selecci{\'{o}}n evolutiva. En su momento fue una forma de ver las cosas al rev{\'{e}}s sobre muchas ideas tradicionales sobre la evoluci{\'{o}}n centrada en los individuos o las especies (por no hablar respecto a las ideas religiosas al respecto), pero actualmente hay cierto consenso en la comunidad cient{\'{i}}fica sobre que esta idea es la que probablemente m{\'{a}}s se acerca a la realidad.},

@book{Gombrich1960,
abstract = {Described by Kenneth Clark as 'one of the most brilliant books of art criticism that I have ever read', Art and Illusion is a classic study of image-making. It seeks to answer a simple question: why is there such a thing as style? The question may be simple but there is no easy answer, and Professor Gombrich's brilliant and wide-ranging exploration of the history and psychology of pictorial representation leads him into countless crucial areas. Gombrich examines, questions and re-evaluates old and new ideas on such matters as the imitation of nature, the function of tradition, the problem of abstraction, the validity of perspective and the interpretation of expression: all of which reveal that pictorial representation is far from being a straightforward matter. First published more than 40 years ago, Art and Illusion has lost none of its vitality and importance. In applying the findings of experimental science to a nuanced understanding of art and in tackling complex ideas and theoretical issues, Gombrich is rigorous. Yet he always retains a sense of wonder at the inexhaustible capacity of the human brain, and at the subtlety of the relationships involved in seeing the world and in making and seeing art. With profound knowledge and his exceptional gift for clear exposition, he advances each argument as an hypothesis to be tested. The problems of representation are forever fundamental to the history of art: Art and Illusion remains an essential text for anyone interested in understanding the complexities of art. For the sixth edition Professor Gombrich has written an entirely new 12-page preface, in which he makes use of the distinction between an image and a sign, so as to clarify his intentions in writing the book in the first place.},

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21% with default Glide SP settings to 58% with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63% success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40% of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

abstract = {These lectures outline the project of a general organology, which is to say an account of life when it is no longer just biological but technical, or when it involves not just organic matter but organized inorganic matter. This organology is also shown to require a modified Simondonian account of the shift from vital individuation to a three-stranded process of psychic, collective and technical individuation. Furthermore, such an approach involves extending the Derridean reading of Socrates's discussion of writing as a pharmakon, so that it becomes a more general account of the pharmacological character of retention and protention. By going back to Leroi-Gourhan, we can recognize that this also means pursuing the history of retentional modifications unfolding in the course of the history of what, with Lotka, can also be called exosomatization. It is thus a question of how exteriorization can, today, in an epoch when it becomes digital, and in an epoch that produces vast amounts of entropy at the thermodynamic, biological and noetic levels, still possibly produce new forms of interiorization, that is, new forms of thought, care and desire, amounting to so many chances to struggle against the planetaryscale pharmacological crisis with which we are currently afflicted.{\^{A}}},

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21% with default Glide SP settings to 58% with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63% success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40% of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

abstract = {Those of us involved in the creation of the Handbook of Artificial Intelligence, both writers and editors, have attempted to make the concepts, methods, tools, and main results of artificial intelligence research accessible to a broad scientific and engineering audience. Currently, Al work is familiar mainly to its practicing specialists and other interested computer scientists. Yet the field is of growing Interdisciplinary interest and practical importance. With this book we are trying to build bridges that are easily - crossed by engineers, scientists in other fields, and our own computer science colleagues. t In the Handbook we intend to cover the breadth and depth of Al, presenting general overviews of the scientific issues, as well as detailed discussions of particular techniques and important Al systems. Throughout we have tried to keep in mind the reader who is not a specialist in Al. As the cost of computation continues to fall, new areas of computer applications become potentially viable. For many of these areas, there do not exist mathematical "cores" to structure calculations use of the computer. Such areas will inevitably be served by symbolic models and symbolic inference techniques. Yet those who understand symbolic computation have been speaking largely to themselves for twenty years. We feel that it is urgent for Al to "go public" in the manner intended by the Handbook. Several other writers have recognized a need for more widespread knowledge of Al and have attempted to help fill the vacuum. Lay reviews, in particular Margaret Boden's Artificial Intelligence and Natural Man, have tried to explain what is important and interesting about Al, and how research in Al progresses through our programs. In addition, there are a few textbooks that attempt to present a more detailed view of selected areas °f Al, for the serious student of computer science. But no textbook can hope to describe all of the sub-areas, to present brief explanations of the Important Ideas and techniques, and to review the forty or fifty most important Al systems. The Handbook contains several different types of articles. Key Al ideas and techniques are described in core articles (e.g., basic concepts in heuristic search, semantic nets), 'mportant individual Al programs (e.g., SHRDLU) are described in separate articles that indicate, among other things, the designer's goal, the techniques employed, and the reasons why the program is important. Overview articles discuss the problems and approaches in Q ach major area. The overview articles should be particularly useful to those who seek a summary of the underlying issues that motivate Al research.},

Suitable for use as a textbook or for self-study by professionals, it concentrates on undergraduate-level fundamental concepts and techniques that will enable readers to proceed with building applications on their own. It includes exercises, project descriptions, and annotated references to relevant online materials. A Semantic Web Primer is the only available book on the Semantic Web to include a systematic treatment of the different languages (XML, RDF, OWL, and rules) and technologies (explicit metadata, ontologies, and logic and inference) that are central to Semantic Web development. The book also examines such crucial related topics as ontology engineering and application scenarios. After an introductory chapter, topics covered in succeeding chapters include XML and related technologies that support semantic interoperability; RDF and RDF Schema, the standard data model for machine-processable semantics; and OWL, the W3C-approved standard for a Web ontology language more extensive than RDF Schema; rules, both monotonic and nonmonotonic, in the framework of the Semantic Web; selected application domains and how the Semantic Web would benefit them; the development of ontology-based systems; and current debates on key issues and predictions for the future.},

As an example, consider the evolution of digital cameras: the first models available in the market in the early nineties produced images composed of 1.6 million pixels (this is the meaning of the expression 1.6 megapixels), carried an onboard memory of 16megabytes, and had an average cost higher than 10,000 U.S. dollars. At the time this book is being written, the best models are close to or even above 8 megapixels, have internal memories of one gigabyte and they cost around 1,000 U.S. dollars. In other words, while resolution and memory capacity have been multiplied by around five and fifty, respectively, the price has been divided by more than ten. Similar trends can be observed in all other kinds of digital devices including videocameras, cellular phones, mp3 players, personal digital assistants (PDA), etc. As a result, large amounts of digital material are being accumulated and need to be managed effectively in order to avoid the problem of information overload.},

However, even invertebrates can create complex architecture using apparently stereotyped behavior routines. The anatomy employed for building behavior is jaws and/or paired limbs but these generally show little specialisation. Building materials can be either collected or self-secreted. Unlike collected materials, self-secreted ones such as mucus and silk are highly specialised, having co-evolved with the building behavior. The functions of built structures are, in order of importance, homes, traps and signals. Materials used in home building are varied. However, traps, which take the form of webs or nets, require advanced engineering and therefore require self-secreted materials; only invertebrates and some chordate Appendicularia make these structures. Devices used by vertebrates to obtain food take the form of tools; these are generally simple structures made from collected materials. Builders add complexity to the environment. In doing so they can enhance biological diversity and influence their own evolutionary pathway by inheriting environments that have already been altered by previous generations.},

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy bynhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21% with default Glide SP settings to 58% with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63% success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40% of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

@book{Bataille1973,
abstract = {Cosmetic products are generally formulated as emulsions, ointments, solutions or powders containing active ingredients. According to EU legislation, a cosmetic product is "any substance or preparation intended to be placed in contact with the various external parts of the human body with a view exclusively or mainly to cleaning, perfuming them, changing their appearance, and/or correcting body odors and/or protecting them or keeping them in good conditions". However, science advancement in both active carriers and ingredients has streamlined the process through which many cosmetic products by their delivery systems can induce modifications on the skin physiology. This is the reason why Reed and Kligman redefined these products as "cosmeceuticals", which refers to the combination of cosmetics and pharmaceuticals. Until recently, the term of cosmeceuticals has not had legal significance. The so-called cosmeceuticals, in fact, may induce modifications on the skin physiology, modifying, for example, transepidermal water loss, keratinocytes cohesion and turnover, modulating the inflammatory cascade, and/or altering the surface microbiota by the activity of the preservatives content. For these reasons, they are claimed to have medical or drug-like benefits. Naturally, their effectiveness on minor skin disorders or mild skin abnormalities has to be shown by in vitro and in vivo studies. On the other hand, their formulations contain emulsifiers, preservatives, and other chemicals which, by their cumulative use, may provoke side effects, such as allergic and/or sensitization phenomena. Moreover, many ingredients and packaging for such products are not biodegradable. In this study, we would like to introduce an innovative category of cosmeceuticals made by biodegradable nonwoven tissues. These cosmeceutical tissues, produced through the use of natural fibers, may bind different active ingredients and therefore become effective as antibacterial, anti-inflammatory, sun-protective, whitening, or anti-aging products, depending on the ingredient(s) used. Differently from the usual cosmetics, they do not contain preservatives, emulsifiers, colors, and other chemicals. They can be applied as dried tissue on wet skin, remaining in loco for around 30 min, slowly releasing the active ingredients entrapped into the fibers. It is interesting to underline that the tissue, acting as a carrier, has its own effectiveness via chitin and lignin polymers with an antibacterial and anti-inflammatory activity. When hydrolyzed by the human microbiota enzymes, they give rise to ingredients used as cell nourishment or energy. This paper will review part of the scientific research results, supporting this new category of biodegradable cosmetic products known as facial mask sheets.},

How have the relatively benign post-Ice Age conditions affected the evolution and spread of humanity across the globe? By setting our genetic history in the context of climate change during prehistory, the origin of many features of our modern world are identified and presented in this illuminating book. It reviews the aspects of our physiology and intellectual development that have been influenced by climatic factors, and how features of our lives - diet, language and the domestication of animals - are also the product of the climate in which we evolved. In short: climate change in prehistory has in many ways made us what we are today. Climate Change in Prehistory weaves together studies of the climate with anthropological, archaeological and historical studies, and will fascinate all those interested in the effects of climate on human development and history.},

abstract = {Stuart Kauffman here presents a brilliant new paradigm for evolutionary biology, one that extends the basic concepts of Darwinian evolution to accommodate recent findings and perspectives from the fields of biology, physics, chemistry and mathematics. The book drives to the heart of the exciting debate on the origins of life and maintenance of order in complex biological systems. It focuses on the concept of self-organization: the spontaneous emergence of order that is widely observed throughout nature Kauffman argues that self-organization plays an important role in the Darwinian process of natural selection. Yet until now no systematic effort has been made to incorporate the concept of self-organization into evolutionary theory. The construction requirements which permit complex systems to adapt are poorly understood, as is the extent to which selection itself can yield systems able to adapt more successfully. This book explores these themes. It shows how complex systems, contrary to expectations, can spontaneously exhibit stunning degrees of order, and how this order, in turn, is essential for understanding the emergence and development of life on Earth. Topics include the new biotechnology of applied molecular evolution, with its important implications for developing new drugs and vaccines; the balance between order and chaos observed in many naturally occurring systems; new insights concerning the predictive power of statistical mechanics in biology; and other major issues. Indeed, the approaches investigated here may prove to be the new center around which biological science itself will evolve. The work is written for all those interested in the cutting edge of research in the life sciences.},

One must consider what can be 'broken' or damaged' in a musical context, and secondly how this sense of impairment might present itself. This article offers an extensive categorisation of musical fragility, and a characterisation of it in its numerous forms across the works of a broad range of composers. Through classification, a distinction between local and large-scale fragility emerges. A typology of fragilities makes it possible both to identify them in works that might not necessarily be considered fragile and to identify works that use combinations of fragility types. This classification involves ten types, with compositions from new and experimental acoustic music offered as examples.},

abstract = {The reconsolidation hypothesis states that a consolidated memory could again become unstable and susceptible to facilitation or impairment for a discrete period of time after a reminder presentation. The phenomenon has been demonstrated in very diverse species and types of memory, including the human procedural memory of a motor skill task but not the human declarative one. Here we provide evidence for both consolidation and reconsolidation in a paired-associate learning (i.e., learning an association between a cue syllable and the respective response syllable). Subjects were given two training sessions with a 24-h interval on distinct verbal material, and afterward, they received at testing two successive retrievals corresponding to the first and second learning, respectively. Two main results are noted. First, the first acquired memory was impaired when a reminder was presented 5 min before the second training (reconsolidation), and also when the second training was given 5 min instead of 24 h after the first one (consolidation). Second, the first retrieval proved to influence negatively on the later one (the retrieval-induced forgetting [RIF] effect), and we used the absence of this RIF effect as a very indicator of the target memory impairment. We consider the demonstration of reconsolidation in human declarative memory as backing the universality of this phenomenon and having potential clinical relevance. On the other hand, we discuss the possibility of using the human declarative memory as a model to address several key topics of the reconsolidation hypothesis. {\textcopyright}2007 by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press.},

abstract = {Memory reconsolidation is defined as a process in which the retrieval of a previously consolidated memory returns to a labile state which is then subject to stabilization. The reminder is the event that begins with the presentation of the learned cue and triggers the labilization-reconsolidation process. Since the early formulation of the hypothesis, several controversial items have arisen concerning the conditions that define reconsolidation. It is herein proposed that two diagnostic features characterize reconsolidation, namely: the labilization of the reactivated memory and the specificity of the reminder structure. To study this proposal, subjects received two different training sessions on verbal material on Day 1 and Day 2, respectively. Finally, they were tested for the first and second acquired memories on Day 3. It is demonstrated that the human declarative memory fulfills the two requirements that define the process. First, the reactivated memory is impaired by a new learning only when it is given closely after the reminder, revealing that the memory is labilized. Second, the omission of at least one of the reminder's components prevents labilization. Therefore, results show that the new learning fails to produce an amnesic effect on the target memory either when the reminder omits the learned cue or includes the beginning of the reinforcement. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {A consolidated memory recalled by a reminder enters a vulnerability phase (labilization), followed by a process of stabilization (reconsolidation). Several authors have suggested that the labilization of the consolidated memory makes the incorporation of new information possible. Here, we demonstrate updating in the framework of memory declarative reconsolidation in humans by giving an opportune verbal instruction. Volunteers learn an association between five cue-syllables (L1) and their respective response-syllables. Twenty-four hours later, the paired-associate verbal memory is labilized by exposing the subjects to the reminder, and then they receive the verbal Instruction of adding three new cue-response syllables (INFO) with their respective responses to the former list of five. The new information is incorporated into the single former L1-memory and both INFO and L1 are successfully retrieved on the third day. However, when the Instruction is not preceded by a proper reminder, or when the instruction omits the order of adding the INFO into the former L1-memory, we observed interference in retrieval of both the original and the new information, suggesting that they are encoded independently and coexist as separate memories. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {This book provides a concise, accessible, and up-to-date introduction to psychological research for musicians, performers, music educators, and studio teachers. Designed to address the needs and priorities of the performing musician rather than the research community, it reviews the relevant psychological research findings in relation to situations and issues faced by musicians, and draws out practical implications for the practice of teaching and performance. Rather than a list of dos and don'ts, the book equips musicians with an understanding of the basic psychological principles that underlie music performance, enabling each reader to apply the content flexibly to the task at hand. Following a brief review of the scientific method as a way of thinking about the issues and problems in music, the text addresses the nature-nurture problem, identification and assessment of musical aptitude, musical development, adult skill maintenance, technical and expressive skills, practice, interpretation and expressivity, sight-reading, memorization, creativity, and composition, performance anxiety, critical listening, and teaching and learning. While there is a large body of empirical research regarding music, most musicians lack the scientific training to interpret these studies. This text bridges this gap by relating these skills to the musician's experiences, addressing their needs directly with non-technical language and practical application. It includes multiple illustrations, brief music examples, cases, questions, and suggestions for further reading.},

It is immune mediated, although the precise aetiology remains unknown. RECENT FINDINGS: Research into etiopathogenesis and epidemiology, diagnosis of cholangiocarcinoma, associations with inflammatory bowel disease and autoimmune pancreatitis, and medical therapy are discussed. SUMMARY: Multiple gene polymorphisms associated with primary sclerosing cholangitis have been investigated. Common inflammatory bowel disease-associated polymorphisms do not confer any susceptibility to primary sclerosing cholangitis; the role of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 gene polymorphisms and CCR5 mutations remain unclear. Elevated IgG4 has been demonstrated in a subgroup of primary sclerosing cholangitis patients, which may indicate an overlap with autoimmune pancreatitis and possible responsiveness to steroids. Biliary brush cytology may assist in diagnosis of cholangiocarcinoma, although further clinical indicators are required. Animal studies suggest the superiority of 24-norursodeoxycholic acid over ursodeoxycholic acid in reducing histological disease progress; translational studies in humans are now required. {\textcopyright} 2007 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Inc.},

abstract = {Studies of mechanisms in the brain that allow complicated things to happen in a coordinated fashion have produced some of the most spectacular discoveries in neuroscience. This book provides support for the idea that spontaneous neuron activity, far from being mere noise, is actually the source of our cognitive abilities. It looks at the co-evolution of structure and function in the mammalian brain, illustrating how self-emerged oscillatory timing is the brains fundamental organizer of neuronal information. The small world-like connectivity of the cerebral cortex allows for global computation on multiple spatial and temporal scales. The perpetual interactions among the multiple network oscillators keep cortical systems in a highly sensitive metastable state and provide energy-efficient synchronizing mechanisms via weak links. In a sequence of cycles, this book travels from the physics of oscillations through neuronal assembly organization to complex cognitive processing and memory storage.},

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21% with default Glide SP settings to 58% with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63% success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40% of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

abstract = {Sonic fiction is everywhere: in conversations about vernacular culture, in music videos, sound art compositions and on record sleeves, in everyday encounters with sonic experiences and in every single piece of writing about sound. Where one can find sounds one will also detect bits of fiction. In 1998 music critic, DJ and video essayist Kodwo Eshun proposed this concept in his book "More Brilliant Than The Sun: Adventures in Sonic Fiction". Originally, he did so in order to explicate the manifold connections between Afrofuturism and Techno, connecting them to Jazz, Breakbeat and Electronica. His argument, his narrations and his explorative language operations however inspired researchers, artists, and scholars since then. Sonic Fiction became a myth and a mantra, a keyword and a magical spell. This book provides a basic introduction to sonic fiction. In six chapters it explicates the inspirations for and the transformations of this concept; it explores applications and extrapolations in sound art and sonic theory, in musicology, epistemology, in critical and political theory. Sonic fiction is presented in this book as a heuristic for critique and activism.},

abstract = {This book provides the foundations for a neurocomputational explanation of cognition based on contemporary cognitive neuroscience. An ontologically egalitarian account of composition and realization, according to which all levels are equally real, is defended. Multiple realizability and mechanisms are explicated in light of this ontologically egalitarian framework. A goal-contribution account of teleological functions is defended, and so is a mechanistic version of functionalism. This provides the foundation for a mechanistic account of computation, which in turn clarifies the ways in which the computational theory of cognition is a multilevel mechanistic theory supported by contemporary cognitive neuroscience. The book argues that cognition is computational at least in a generic sense. The computational theory of cognition is defended from standard objections yet a priori arguments for the computational theory of cognition are rebutted. The book contends that the typical vehicles of neural computations are representations and that, contrary to the received view, neural representations are observable and manipulable in the laboratory. The book also contends that neural computations are neither digital nor analog; instead, neural computations are sui generis. The book concludes by investigating the relation between computation and consciousness, suggesting that consciousness may have a functional yet not wholly computational nature.},

Numbers are, after all, a part of nature. As such, looking at and thinking about them is a way of understanding our relationship to nature. But when we do so in a technical, professional way, we tend to overlook their basic attributes, the things we can understand by simply "looking at numbers." Tom Johnson is a composer who uses logic and mathematical models, such as combinatorics of numbers, in his music. The patterns he finds while "looking at numbers" can also be explored in drawings. This book focuses on such drawings, their beauty and their mathematical meaning. The accompanying comments were written in collaboration with the mathematician Franck Jedrzejewski.},

The specific objective of this brief reflection is to offer an alternative vision to the definition of life taking as a starting point the traits common to all living beings. Results and Conclusions: Thus, I define life as a process that takes place in highly organized organic structures and is characterized by being preprogrammed, interactive, adaptative and evolutionary. If life is the process, living beings are the system in which this process takes place. I also wonder whether viruses can be considered living things or not. Taking as a starting point my definition of life and, of course, on what others have thought about it, I am in favor of considering viruses as living beings. I base this conclusion on the fact that viruses satisfy all the vital characteristics common to all living things and on the role they have played in the evolution of species. Finally, I argue that if there were life elsewhere in the universe, it would be very similar to what we know on this planet because the laws of physics and the composition of matter are universal and because of the principle of the inexorability of life.},

Related issues, such as domain-specificity, innateness, and brain localization, are addressed in an attempt to offer a unified conceptual basis for the study of music processing. This scheme should facilitate the study of the biological foundations of music by bringing together the fields of genetics, developmental and comparative research, neurosciences, and musicology. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {The present paper discusses an alternative approach to electroacoustic composition based on principles of the interdisciplinary scientific field of Systemics. In this approach, the setting of the electronic device is prepared in such a way to be able to organise its own function, according to the conditions of the sonic environment. We discuss the approaches of Xenakis and of Di Scipio in relation to Systemics, demonstrating the applications in their compositional models. In my critique on Di Scipio's approach, I argue that the composer is giving away a major part of his control over the work and therefore the notion of macro-structural form is abandoned. Based on my work Ephemeron, I show that it is possible to conduct emerging situations applying the systemic principle of 'equifinality'. Moreover, I argue that it is possible to acquire control over these situations and their properties over time so as to develop formal structure.},

abstract = {TIle goal of the research described in tllls thesis is to find ways of using artificial intelligence to encourage and facilitate music composition by musical novices, particularly those without traditional musical skills. Two complementary approaches are presented. We show how tv.'o recent cognitive theories of hannony can be used to design a new kind of direct manipulation tool for music, known as "Hannony Space", with the expressivity 10 allow novices to sketch, analyse, modify and compose hannonic sequences simply and clearly by moving two-dimensional patterns on a computer screen linker to a synthesizer . Hannony Space provides novices with a way of describing and controlling hannonic structures and relationships using a single , principled, unifonn spatial metaphor at various musicalleve1s; note level , interval level, chord level, hanllonic succession level and key level. A prototype interface has been implemented to demonstrate the coherence and feasibility of the design. An investigation with a small number of subjects demonstrates that Hanllony Space considerably reduces the prerequisites required for novices to learn about, sketch, analyse and experiment with hannony - activities that would nomlally be very difficult for them without considerable theoretical knowledge or instmmental skill . TIle second part of the thesis presents work towards a knowledge-based tutoring system to help novices using the interface to compose chord sequences. It is argued that traditional, remedial intelligent tutoring systems approaches are inadequate for nltoring in domains that require open-ended thinking. TIle foundation of a new approach is developed based on the exploration and transfonnation of case snl<lies described in tenns of chunks , styles and plans. 1llls approach draws on a characterisation of creativity due to Johnson-Laird (1988). Programs have been implemented to illustrate the feasibility of key parts of the new approach .},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Several studies have evaluated a relationship between increased red cell distribution width (RDW) and morbidity and mortality of acute coronary syndrome (ACS). In this study, we aimed to investigate the association of serum RDW levels and development of coronary collateral vessel (CCV) in patients with ACS.\n\nSTUDY DESIGN: We evaluated 226 patients with ACS in this prospective and cross-sectional study. Traditional laboratory and clinical parameters and serum RDW levels were measured on admission. All patients underwent coronary angiography on the first day after admission and patients with >80% stenosis were included in the study. The CCV was graded according to the Rentrop scoring system, and a Rentrop grade 0 was accepted as no CCV development (Group 1), while Rentrop grades 1-2-3 were accepted as presence of CCV development (Group 2).\n\nRESULTS: Only levels of RDW were significantly higher in Group 1 than in Group 2 (Group 1 RDW 14.6±1.9, Group 2 RDW 14.1±1.4, p=0.02). The predictive value of serum RDW level for absence of collaterals (sensitivity of 58% and specificity of 54%, area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve = 0.573) was 13.90.\n\nCONCLUSION: We found that high levels of RDW were associated with absence of CCV in patients with ACS.},

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21% with default Glide SP settings to 58% with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63% success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40% of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

In the 1990s,new media artists began appropriating and adapting the techniques of a-lifescience to create a-life art; Mitchell Whitelaw's Metacreation is the firstdetailed critical account of this new field of creative practice.A-life art responds to the increasing technologization of living matter bycreating works that seem to mutate, evolve, and respond with a life of theirown. Pursuing a-life's promise of emergence, these artists produce not onlyartworks, but generative and creative processes: here creation becomesmetacreation.Whitelaw presents a-life art practice through four of its characteristictechniques and tendencies. "Breeders" use artificial evolution to generateimages and forms, in the process altering the artist's creative agency."Cybernatures" form complex, interactive systems, drawing the audience intoartificial ecosystems. Other artists work in "Hardware," adapting RodneyBrooks's "bottom-up" robotics to create embodied autonomous agencies. The"Abstract Machines" of a-life art de-emphasize the biological analogy, usingtechniques such as cellular automata to investigate pattern, form andmorphogenesis.In the book's concluding chapters, Whitelaw surveys the theoretical discoursesaround a-life art, before finally examining emergence, a concept central toa-life, and key, it is argued, to a-life art.},

abstract = {The Algorithmic Beauty of Plants explores mathematical models of developmental processes and structures of plants, and illustrates them using state-of-the-art computer-generated images. Plant models which grow, interact with the environment, produce flowers and fruits, and finally die, have an immense intuitive appeal of "bringing life into a computer." In front of a graphics monitor it is easy to forget the underlying mathematical formulae and simply look at plants growing, self-replicating, responding to external factors, even mutating. Without compromising the mathematical rigor of presentation the authors have tried to preserve this "touch of magic" accompanying in their research. The following areas receive particular attention: methods for the modeling and rendering of plants which are suitable for realistic image synthesis; the scientific potential of computer graphics in the visualization of biological structures and processes; the relationship between control mechanisms employed by li- ing plants and the resulting complex developmental sequences and structures; and the relationship between developmental processes, self-similarity and fractals. The formalism of L-systems are adopted as the primary mathematical vehicle used to express developmental processes. The notion of L-systems was conceived in 1968 by Aristid Lindenmayer as a formal model of plant development. Its exceptional elegance was promptly recognized by mathematicians, who soon developed a comprehensive theory of L-systems. However, only recently has computer graphics revealed the full potential of L-systems applied to plant modeling. Although the focus is on the original results of joint research led by the authors, a survey of alternative methods for plant modeling is also included.},

@book{Bryant2016,
abstract = {Continental philosophy has entered a new period of ferment. The long deconstructionist era was followed with a period dominated by Deleuze; which has in turn evolved into a new situation still difficult to define. However; one common thread running through the new brand of continental positions is a renewed attention to materialist and realist options in philosophy. Among the leaders of the established generation; this new focus takes numerous forms. It might be hard to find many shared positions in the writings of Badiou; DeLanda; Laruelle; Latour; Stengers; and {\v{Z}}i{\v{z}}ek; but what is missing from their positions is an obsession with the critique of written texts. All of them elaborate a positive ontology; despite the incompatibility of their results. Meanwhile; the new generation of continental thinkers is pushing these trends still further; as seen in currents ranging from transcendental materialism to the London-based speculative realism movement to new revivals of Derrida. As indicated by the title The Speculative Turn; the new currents of continental philosophy depart from the text-centered hermeneutic models of the past and engage in daring speculations about the nature of reality itself. This anthology assembles authors; of several generations and numerous nationalities; who will be at the centre of debate in continental philosophy for decades to come.},

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21% with default Glide SP settings to 58% with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63% success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40% of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

To what extent is the perceived fictional nature of movies different from our daily perception of the real world?0We live in a time where the power of images has strongly invaded our everyday life, and we need new instruments and methods to better understand our relationship with the virtual worlds we inhabit every day. Taking cinema as the beginning of our relationship with the world of moving images, and cognitive neuroscience as a paradigm to understand how the images engage us, The Empathic Screen develops a new theory of film experience, exploring our brain-body interaction when engaging with and0watching a film. In this book, film theory and neuroscience meet to shed new light on cinema masterpieces, such as The Shining, The Silence of the Lambs, and Toy Story, and explore the great directors from the classical period to the present. 0Taking a radical new approach to understanding the cinema, the book will be fascinating reading for cognitive scientists, neuroscientists, psychologists, philosophers, and film and media scholars.},

abstract = {Foley, the art of producing additional sound effects in synchrony to actions on screen, only forms a part of the use of sound effects in a film. It is akin to other ‘dark arts' such as ventriloquism as it relies on the same manipulations of context and space. Because Foley perceptually links us to human gesture it offers a particularly useful model with which to understand not only cinematic reception but also our relationship with everyday sounds and music making. Although within the artificial environment of the cinema our perception is often played with and distorted, the controlled context of cinema is a useful laboratory in which to examine our responses to sound. This is a context from which we can develop a deeper understanding of our reception of sound outside of the cinematic realm. The text below uses our responses to the production of sound effects and in particular Foley, to examine critically different, and sometimes converging, strands of thinking around perception, listening practice, audiovisual theory and music.},

abstract = {Como dijera alguna vez Fredric Jameson, hoy parece “m{\'{a}}s f{\'{a}}cil imaginar el fin del mundo que el fin del capitalismo”. Despu{\'{e}}s de la ca{\'{i}}da del muro de Berl{\'{i}}n, el capitalismo logr{\'{o}} erigirse como el {\'{u}}nico sistema pol{\'{i}}tico-econ{\'{o}}mico viable; una situaci{\'{o}}n que la crisis bancaria de 2008, lejos de poner fin, agrav{\'{o}}. Este libro analiza los principales rasgos y mecanismos de este realismo capitalista, como el marco ideol{\'{o}}gico en el cual vivimos. Utilizando ejemplos de la pol{\'{i}}tica, el cine, la m{\'{u}}sica y la literatura, Mark Fisher demuestra de qu{\'{e}} manera el realismo capitalista permea todas las {\'{a}}reas de la experiencia contempor{\'{a}}nea, cubriendo el horizonte de lo pensable y obturando la capacidad de imaginar un nuevo escenario cultural y sociopol{\'{i}}tico. El famoso eslogan de Margaret Thatcher, seg{\'{u}}n el cual “no hay alternativa”, situ{\'{o}} al liberalismo econ{\'{o}}mico y con ello al libre comercio y la desregulaci{\'{o}}n del mercado como el mejor y {\'{u}}nico modo para organizar las sociedades modernas. Realismo capitalista indaga en los numerosos efectos nocivos que esta “ontolog{\'{i}}a de los negocios” tiene para la vida p{\'{u}}blica, dejando al desnudo que el capitalismo es todo menos un orden natural inevitable y eficiente. La precarizaci{\'{o}}n del trabajo, la intensificaci{\'{o}}n de la cultura del consumo, la expansi{\'{o}}n de la burocracia y de los mecanismos de control social, la gerencializaci{\'{o}}n de la pol{\'{i}}tica, la mercantilizaci{\'{o}}n de la educaci{\'{o}}n y el aumento de padecimientos mentales como el estr{\'{e}}s, la depresi{\'{o}}n y los des{\'{o}}rdenes de atenci{\'{o}}n se muestran bajo esta perspectiva ya no como “errores honestos” de un sistema que tiende al bien com{\'{u}}n, sino como dispositivos orientados a bloquear toda capacidad colectiva de transformaci{\'{o}}n. Ante este escenario, el {\'{u}}nico ant{\'{i}}doto posible esbozado por Fisher en los dos textos que componen el Ap{\'{e}}ndice y que se agregan especialmente para esta edici{\'{o}}n, pasa por la revitalizaci{\'{o}}n de una esfera p{\'{u}}blica que asuma las ra{\'{i}}ces sociales de nuestra infelicidad.},

abstract = {A deeply researched warning about how the digital economy threatens artists' lives and work―the music, writing, and visual art that sustain our souls and societies―from an award-winning essayist and critic There are two stories you hear about earning a living as an artist in the digital age. One comes from Silicon Valley. There's never been a better time to be an artist, it goes. If you've got a laptop, you've got a recording studio. If you've got an iPhone, you've got a movie camera. And if production is cheap, distribution is free: it's called the Internet. Everyone's an artist; just tap your creativity and put your stuff out there. The other comes from artists themselves. Sure, it goes, you can put your stuff out there, but who's going to pay you for it? Everyone is not an artist. Making art takes years of dedication, and that requires a means of support. If things don't change, a lot of art will cease to be sustainable. So which account is true? Since people are still making a living as artists today, how are they managing to do it? William Deresiewicz, a leading critic of the arts and of contemporary culture, set out to answer those questions. Based on interviews with artists of all kinds, The Death of the Artist argues that we are in the midst of an epochal transformation. If artists were artisans in the Renaissance, bohemians in the nineteenth century, and professionals in the twentieth, a new paradigm is emerging in the digital age, one that is changing our fundamental ideas about the nature of art and the role of the artist in society.},

@book{Feenberg2010,
abstract = {The technologies, markets, and administrations of today's knowledge society are in crisis. We face recurring disasters in every domain: climate change, energy shortages, economic meltdown. The system is broken, despite everything the technocrats claim to know about science, technology, and economics. These problems are exacerbated by the fact that today powerful technologies have unforeseen effects that disrupt everyday life; the new masters of technology are not restrained by the lessons of experience, and accelerate change to the point where society is in constant turmoil. In Between Reason and Experience, leading philosopher of technology Andrew Feenberg makes a case for the interdependence of reason--scientific knowledge, technical rationality--and experience. Feenberg examines different aspects of the tangled relationship between technology and society from the perspective of critical theory of technology, an approach he has pioneered over the past twenty years. Feenberg points to two examples of democratic interventions into technology: the Internet and the environmental movement. He examines methodological applications of critical theory of technology to the case of the French Minitel computing network and to the relationship between national culture and technology in Japan. Finally, Feenberg considers the philosophies of technology of Heidegger, Habermas, Latour, and Marcuse. The gradual extension of democracy into the technical sphere, Feenberg argues, is one of the great political transformations of our time},

The term was introduced into political theory to designate a certain nihilistic alignment of philosophical thought with the excesses of capitalist culture (or anticulture), embodied in writings that sought an immanence with this process of alienation.

abstract = {El aceleracionismo es una herej{\'{i}}a pol{\'{i}}tica: sostiene que hay deseos, tecnolog{\'{i}}as y procesos que el capitalismo hace surgir y de los que se alimenta, pero que no puede contener; y que es necesario acelerar estos procesos para empujar al sistema m{\'{a}}s all{\'{a}} de sus l{\'{i}}mites. Teniendo como antecedentes te{\'{o}}ricos al notable “Fragmento sobre las m{\'{a}}quinas” de Marx, los vol{\'{u}}menes sobre capitalismo y esquizofrenia de Deleuze y Guattari, y la ficci{\'{o}}n especulativa de autores como Samuel Buttler, William Gibson y J.G. Ballard (para quien “el futuro es una mejor gu{\'{i}}a para el presente que el pasado”), los aceleracionistas se preguntan c{\'{o}}mo liberar las fuerzas productivas cautivas bajo la ideolog{\'{i}}a neoliberal, para redirigirlas hacia objetivos comunes. En este proyecto, la actual base material no necesita ser destruida, sino que es reapropiada como plataforma de lanzamiento hacia un futuro postcapitalista. Pues, ciertamente, a{\'{u}}n no sabemos lo que un cuerpo tecno-social moderno puede hacer. Desde la publicaci{\'{o}}n en 2013 del “Manifiesto por una Pol{\'{i}}tica Aceleracionista” de Alex Williams y Nick Srnicek estas tesis han sido adoptadas por un grupo convergente de nuevas iniciativas progresistas, al mismo tiempo que vehementemente contestadas por sus cr{\'{i}}ticos. Este rico intercambio, que intentamos reflejar en la presente antolog{\'{i}}a, tuvo la virtud de reactivar y actualizar un campo hist{\'{o}}rico de tensiones cuyo eje es la relaci{\'{o}}n entre los efectos alienantes de la tecnolog{\'{i}}a y el sistema de valor capitalista. A la desesperanza dominante en la izquierda contempor{\'{a}}nea, que se consuela con la estridente denuncia o con la creencia autocomplaciente de que mantener una adusta cr{\'{i}}tica desde el refugio de la teor{\'{i}}a o la “indeterminaci{\'{o}}n” del arte constituye resistencia, el aceleracionismo contrapone una imagen especulativa de otros futuros posibles y un mapa cognitivo para la identificaci{\'{o}}n de aquellos elementos de este sistema que pueden ser eficaces en una transici{\'{o}}n a esa otra forma de vida. ¿Es posible concebir a la inteligencia artificial, la biot{\'{e}}cnica y el dinero virtual como algo m{\'{a}}s que medios de producci{\'{o}}n optimizados para la obtenci{\'{o}}n de rendimiento econ{\'{o}}mico? ¿Y en qu{\'{e}} podr{\'{i}}a convertirse el concepto mismo de lo “humano” si algunas de estas potencialidades latentes, tales como la abolici{\'{o}}n de la necesidad de trabajar o la crisis de las categor{\'{i}}as esencialistas de identidad, fueran liberadas al interior de un nuevo socius postcapitalista? Se trata de un debate fundamental a la hora de abrir nuevas perspectivas para las aventuras sociales y pol{\'{i}}ticas por venir.},

"Cuando las piedras golpean contra la madera, cuando los ratos cósmicos desintegran a los protones, se nos dice que debemos dejar el asunto en manos de los físicos. La filosofía fue renunciando gradualmente a su pretensión de tener una relación directa con el mundo en sí, erigiéndose como el amo de ese solo intervalo que media entre el sujeto y el objeto, desde el que legisla en una secuencia interminable de paradojas y disputas partisianas. Pero, detrás de estas discusiones sin fin, la realidad se sigue moviendo. Los copos de nueve bailan bajo la luz que los aniquila sin piedad. Mientras lo filósofos se aporrean entre sí sobre la posibilidad del "acceso" al mundo, los tiburones persigen al atún y los glaciares golpean contra la costa. ¿Cuánto tiempo más la filosofía va a seguir satisfecha sin dirigirles la palabra? ¿Cuánto tiempo más vamos a encerrar juntos a los monos, los tornados y los diamantes bajo la etiqueta de "lo que yace afuera"? ¿Podría existir, en cambio, algo parecido a una filosofía orientada a objetos, una especie de alquimia capaz de describir las transformaciones de una entidad a otra, capaz de trazar las formas en las que las entidades seducen y destruyen a seres humanos y no humanos por igual?" Representante anglosajón de la reciente corriente filosófica bautizada como realismo especulativo, Graham Harman explicita en este libro los alcances de dicho movimiento, a la vez que traza los lineamientos de su propio modelo dentro del mismo, la ontología orientada a objetos. Esta perspectiva promete superar los dilemas del acceso humano a la realidad en torno a los que han oribitado las filosofías de la conciencia y del lenguaje mediante un giro que recupera la especulación como vía de acceso al ser de las cosas. A partir de originales lecturas de autores como Heidegger, Whitehead, Ortega y Gasset, McLuhan, Bruno Latour, y Clement Greenberg, esta compilación de ensayos logra darnos una idea del alcance que esta novedosa aventura del pensamiento tieno no solo para la filosofía sino también para las ciencias sociales y la estética.},

@book{Sotomayor2020,
abstract = {Game theory is the study ofdecision problems which involve several individ- uals (the decision-makers or players) interacting rationally. The models of game theory are abstract representations ofa number ofreal-life situations and have applications to economics, political sciences, computer sciences, evolu- tionary biology, social psychology, and law, among others. These applications are also important for the development of the theory, since the questions that emerge may lead to new theoretic results. This volume provides the main features ofGame Theory, covering most of the fundamental theoretical aspects under the cooperative, non-cooperative, and “general” or “mixed” approaches. The cooperative approach focuses on the possible outcomes of the decision-makers' interaction by abstracting from the actions or decisions that may lead to these outcomes. Specifically, cooperative game theory studies the interactions among coalitions ofplayers. Its main question is: Given the sets of feasible payoffs for each coalition, what payoffwill be awarded to each player? One can take a positive or normative approach to answering this question, and different solution concepts in the theory lead towards one or the other. The non-cooperative approach focuses on the actions that the decision- makers can take. As argued by John von Neumann and Oskar Morgenstern in their famous 1944 book titled Theory ofGames and Economic Behavior, most economic questions should be analyzed as games. Some games are dynamic, stressing the sequential nature of the various decisions that agents can make. Other situations are better modeled as static games. The volume also considers contributions of game theory to mechanism design, which has helped the development ofother key research areas such as auction theory, contract theory, and two-sided matching theory. Given the importance of these areas in game theory and in economics, several chapters are devoted to their study. The reader can also appreciate the many applications of game theory to practical problems in several contributions to this volume. Finally, a section is dedicated to the modeling and simulation paradigm known as agent-based modeling (ABM) that is markedly useful in studying complex systems made up of a large number of interdependent objects. This paradigm is relatively immature, even though commonly applied in a broad spectrum of disciplines (game theory included), thus a clear-cut and widely accepted definition of high-level concepts of agents, environment, interac- tions, and so on is still lacking. This section addresses the epistemological issues related to the agent-based paradigm ofmodeling ofcomplex systems in order to attempt to reach a more general comprehension ofemergent properties which, though ascribed to the definition of a specific application domain, are also universal. The editors wish to thank the authors for their generosity in providing very valuable and timely contributions as well as their high motivation and strong engagement. We would also like to thank the publisher for the positive and straightforward collaboration, especially Meghna Singh and Neha Thapa for their support throughout the production of this volume.},

@book{Stavrinides2013,
abstract = {Background: Any adjunctive therapy that may reduce persistent disability after stroke should be considered. Acupuncture is used for this purpose, but there is conflicting evidence on its effectiveness. Methods: Patients with a recent (<4 weeks) episode of stroke were randomized to receive 12 sessions of either real or sham acupuncture during 2 weeks. The primary outcome was the change in Barthel activities of daily living score at the end of treatment. Secondary outcome measures included National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score, motoricity index, and quality of life (EQ-5D [EuroQoL-5 Dimensional form] and EQ-VAS [EuroQoL-Visual Analog Scale]). Assessments were carried out by blinded physicians. Results: A total of 116 patients (56 in the real acupuncture group and 60 in the sham group) were randomized, and 98 (real, 48; sham, 50) completed treatment and the 2-week assessment. Patient blinding by means of the sham acupuncture device was successful. Acupuncture was well tolerated except for 1 seizure during a real acupuncture session. The improvements in the Barthel scores were 4 points (interquartile range [IQR], 0-8) vs 3 points (IQR, 0-7) in the real and sham acupuncture groups, respectively (P=.38). The secondary outcome measures also essentially showed no significant effect of acupuncture. Post hoc analysis by baseline severity showed a greater improvement in leg function in the subgroup with baseline Barthel score less than the median (median score, 6): 22 points (IQR, 0-37) vs 4 points (IQR, 0-4) in the acupuncture and sham control groups, respectively (P=.02). Conclusions: Acupuncture is not superior to sham treatment for recovery in activities of daily living and healthrelated quality of life after stroke, although there may be a limited effect on leg function in more severely affected patients. {\textcopyright}2005 American Medical Association.

It demonstrates that the complexity of modern systems is an existential challenge for our ability to understand and research these issues. A new theory is proposed for studying complexity, explaining how system interactionism differs from established ideas, including assemblage and actor network theories. After considering the social system of Niklas Luhmann, the author proposes an interactionist methodology better equipped to deal with system complexity. A description of the logical operations of the digital and political systems is provided, establishing precedents for an analysis of the role of hypertext in shaping the emergent digital-politics. The book demonstrates how the principles of system interactionism can guide digital media research into polarisation and political language.},

abstract = {To speak of the appearance of the music is in this case not trivial, because composers associated with the New Complexity put much effort into finding notations for virtually impalpable microtones, ever-changing rhythmic divisions and tiny gradations of timbre and loudness in an effort to realize their ideal of infinite musical evolution under infinitely fine control and presented with infinite precision {\ldots} The notational detail was significant, even if the music was not; for its intricacy set a benchmark that is never likely to be equaled, let alone surpassed. 1 —Richard Taruskin Within the scholarly community, the vaguely-defined territory encompassed by the term "New Complexity" is infinitely fraught with misconceptions. No one wishes to lay claim to the neologism, and composers associated with the term seek distance from it. 2 Nevertheless, Claus-Steffen Mahnkopf has recently attempted to define the term and suggests that the music has its roots in the 1970s with works such as Brian Ferneyhough's La Terre est un Homme, with consequent elaboration in the 1980s. 3 Though Mahnkopf does not specify the nature of this elaboration, Darmstadt's summer courses clearly provided an important gathering place for composers such as Richard Barrett, Chris Dench, James Dillon, Michael Finnissy and Roger Redgate, who were willing to invest time into investigating the ideas of complexity. The term New Complexity, within this paper, refers to a series of compositions fueled by Darmstadt's summer courses during the 1980s and early '90s that complexify the relationships between composer, score, performer, and listener.},

abstract = {This ground-breaking synthesis of evolutionary and cultural theory draws on theories of complex adaptive systems and biosemiotics in order to argue that - far from being opposed to nature - culture is the way that nature has evolved in human beings. Wendy Wheeler's argument is that these evolutionary processes reveal the fundamental sociality of human creatures - she rejects the selfish individualism that is implied both in the biological reductionism of much recent evolutionary psychology, and in the philosophies of neoliberalism. Instead she shows that the complex structures of biosemiotic evolution have always involved a creativity which is born from the difficult but productive phenomenological encounter between the Self and its Others; and she argues that this creativity, in both the sciences and the humanities, is fundamental to human progress. In this major contribution to both cultural studies and eco-criticism, Wheeler shows how complexity and biosemiotics forge the link between nature and culture, and provide a new and better understanding of how 'the whole human creature' operates as both social and biological being.},

abstract = {We give an introduction to the design of mechanisms for profit maximization with a focus on singleparameter settings. Introduction In previous chapters, we have studied the design of truthful mechanisms that implement social choice functions, such as social welfare maximization. Another fundamental objective, and the focus of this chapter, is the design of mechanisms in which the goal of the mechanism designer is profit maximization. In economics, this topic is referred to as optimal mechanism design. Our focus will be on the design of profit-maximizing auctions in settings in which an auctioneer is selling (respectively, buying) a set of goods/services. Formally, there are n agents, each of whom desires some particular service. We assume that agents are single-parameter; i.e., agent i's valuation for receiving service is vi and their valuation for no service is normalized to zero. A mechanism takes as input sealed bids from the agents, where agent i's bid bi represents his valuation vi, and computes an outcome consisting of an allocation x = (x1, {\ldots}, xn) and prices p = (p1, {\ldots}, pn). Setting xi = 1 represents agent i being allocated service whereas xi = 0 is for no service, and pi is the amount agent i is required to pay the auctioneer. We assume that agents have quasi-linear utility expressed by ui = vixi - pi.},

The method uses no background knowledge about music whatsoever: it is completely general and can, without change, be used in different areas like linguistic classification, literature, and genomics. Indeed, it can be used to simultaneously cluster objects from completely different domains, like with like. It is based on an ideal theory of the information content in individual objects (Kolmogorov complexity), information distance, and a universal similarity metric. The approximation to the universal similarity metric obtained using standard data compressors is called "normalized compression distance (NCD)." Experiments using our CompLearn software tool show that the method distinguishes between various musical genres and can even cluster pieces by composer. {\textcopyright} 2004 IEEE.},

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy bynhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21% with default Glide SP settings to 58% with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63% success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40% of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

@article{Galanter2003,
abstract = {In this paper an attempt is made to offer a definition of generative art that is inclusive and provides fertile ground for both technical and art theoretical development. First the use of systems is identified as a key element in generative art. Various ideas from complexity theory are then introduced. It is noted that systems exist on a continuum from the highly ordered to the highly disordered. Citing examples from information theory and complexity science, it is noted that highly ordered and highly disordered systems are typically viewed as simple, and complex systems exhibit both order and disorder. This leads to the adoption of effective complexity, order, and disorder as organizing principles in the comparison of various generative art systems. This inclusive view leads to the somewhat surprising observation that generative art is as old as art itself. A number of specific artists and studies are discussed within this systems and complexity theory influenced paradigm. Finally a number of art theoretical questions are introduced to exercise the suggested generative art definition and implicit paradigm.},

In order to highlight how computational thinking extends music education and builds on interdisciplinary links, the chapter canvasses the challenges, and solutions, involved in learning through algorithmic music. Practical examples from informal and school-based educational contexts are included to illustrate how algorithmic music has been successfully integrated with established and emerging pedagogical approaches.},

abstract = {In Drosophila, the neuropeptide pigment-dispersing factor (PDF) is required to maintain behavioral rhythms under constant conditions. To understand how PDF exerts its influence, we performed time-series immunostainings for the PERIOD protein in normal and pdf mutant flies over 9 d of constant conditions. Without pdf, pacemaker neurons that normally express PDF maintained two markers of rhythms: that of PERIOD nuclear translocation and its protein staining intensity. As a group, however, they displayed a gradual dispersion in their phasing of nuclear translocation. A separate group of non-PDF circadian pacemakers also maintained PERIOD nuclear translocation rhythms without pdf but exhibited altered phase and amplitude of PERIOD staining intensity. Therefore, pdf is not required to maintain circadian protein oscillations under constant conditions; however, it is required to coordinate the phase and amplitude of such rhythms among the diverse pacemakers. These observations begin to outline the hierarchy of circadian pacemaker circuitry in the Drosophila brain.},

abstract = {Much of the modern period was dominated by a 'reductionist' theory of science. On this view, to explain any event in the world is to reduce it down to fundamental particles, laws, and forces. In recent years reductionism has been dramatically challenged by a radically new paradigm called 'emergence'. According to this new theory, natural history reveals the continuous emergence of novel phenomena: new structures and new organisms with new causal powers. Consciousness is yet one more emergent level in the natural hierarchy. Many theologians and religious scholars believe that this new paradigm may offer new insights into the nature of God and God's relation to the world. This volume introduces emergence theory, outlines the major arguments in its defence, and summarizes the most powerful objections against it.},

A set of approaches are emerging each representing different applications of the terminology as well as different inherent assumptions on the role of the user, designer and interaction ideals. In this paper, we use the concept of Pragmatist Aesthetics to provide a framework for distinguishing between different approaches to aesthetics. Moreover, we use our own design cases to illustrate how pragmatist aesthetics is a promising path to follow in the context of designing interactive systems, as it promotes aesthetics of use, rather than aesthetics of appearance. We coin this approach in the perspective of aesthetic interaction. Finally we make the point that aesthetics is not re-defining everything known about interactive systems. We provide a framework placing this perspective among other perspectives on interaction.},

abstract = {The proxy, a decoy or surrogate, is today often used to designate a computer server acting as an intermediary for requests from clients. Originating in the Latin procurator, an agent representing others in a court of law, proxies are now emblematic of a post-democratic political age, one increasingly populated by bot militias, puppet states, and communication relays. Thus, the proxy works as a dialectical figure that is woven into the fabric of networks, where action and stance seem to be masked, calculated and remote-controlled.

This publication looks at proxy-politics on both a micro and a macro level, exploring proxies as objects, as well as networks as objects. What is the relation between the molecular and the planetary? How to fathom the computational regime? Yet, whilst being a manifestation of the networked age, thinking like a proxy offers loopholes and strategies for survival within it.

The Research Center for Proxy Politics (RCPP) explores and reflects upon the nature of medial networks and their actors. Between September 2014 and August 2017, the center hosted workshops, lectures and events at the Universit{\"{a}}t der K{\"{u}}nste, Berlin, under the auspices of Hito Steyerl's Lensbased class.

abstract = {All current formulations of thermodynamics invoke some form of coarse-graining or ensembles as the supposed link between their own laws and the microscopic laws of motion. They deal only with ensemble-averages, expectation values, macroscopic limits, infinite heat baths, etc., not with the details of physical variables of individual microscopic systems. They are consistent with the laws of motion for finite systems only in certain approximations, which improve with increasing scale, given various assumptions about initial conditions which are neither specified precisely nor even thought to hold exactly in nature. Here I propose a new formulation of the zeroth, first and second laws, improving upon the axiomatic approach to thermodynamics (Carath\'eodory, 1909; Lieb & Yngvason, 1999), via the principles of the recently proposed constructor theory. Specifically, I provide a non-approximative, scale-independent formulation of 'adiabatic accessibility'; this in turn provides a non-approximative, scale-independent distinction between work and heat and reveals an unexpected connection between information theory and the first law of thermodynamics (not just the second). It also achieves the long-sought unification of the axiomatic approach with Kelvin's.},

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21% with default Glide SP settings to 58% with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63% success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40% of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

Underlying all of these trends is a single idea: the belief that quantitative data can provide a coherent model of the world, and the efficacy of computable information to provide us with ways of acting within it. Yet the sheer volume of information available to us today reveals less than we hope. Rather it heralds a new Dark Age: a world of ever-increasing incomprehension. In his brilliant new work, leading artist and writer James Bridle offers us a warning against the future in which the contemporary promise of a new technologically assisted enlightenment may just deliver its opposite: an age of complex uncertainty, predictive algorithms, surveillance, the hollowing out of empathy.

abstract = {"First published in French as De la misère symbolique, Editions Galilée, 2004"--Title page verso. Vol. 1. The hyperindustrial epoch -- vol. 2. The catastrophe of the sensible. In this important new book, the leading cultural theorist and philosopher Bernard Stiegler re-examines the relationship between politics and aesthetics in our contemporary hyperindustrial age. Stiegler argues that our epoch is characterized by the seizure of the symbolic by industrial technology, where aesthetics has become both theatre and weapon in an economic war. This has resulted in a ‘symbolic misery' where conditioning substitutes for experience. In today's control societies, aesthetic weapons play an essential role: audiovisual and digital technologies have become a means of controlling the conscious and unconscious rhythms of bodies and souls, of modulating the rhythms of consciousness and life. The notion of an aesthetic engagement, capable of founding a new communal sensibility and a genuine aesthetic community, has largely collapsed today. This is because the overwhelming majority of the population is now totally subjected to the aesthetic conditioning of marketing and therefore estranged from any experience of aesthetic inquiry. That part of the population that continues to experiment aesthetically has turned its back on those who live in the misery of this conditioning. Stiegler appeals to the art world to develop a political understanding of its role. In this volume he pays particular attention to cinema which occupies a unique position in the temporal war that is the cause of symbolic misery: at once industrial technology and art, cinema is the aesthetic experience that can combat conditioning on its own territory. "Expanding on Deleuzes idea of 'control societies', Bernard Stiegler provocatively diagnoses the 'misery' of contemporary society as a collective exclusion from the creation of symbols. A war is being waged, he argues: capitalistic marketing is the instrument of choice, the battleground is aesthetics and the fight is for the control of affect." - N. Katherine Hayles "In this decisive contribution to a critical understanding of contemporary life, Stiegler demonstrates how mass exclusion from cultural production constitutes a form of generalized impoverishment, threatening to reduce our existence to mere subsistence. Typically though, he also suggests how we might build alternatives to this 'symbolic misery'. This work forms a vital part of Stiegler's essential project." - Martin Crowley, Queens College, University of Cambridge},

abstract = {Death of the PostHuman undertakes a series of critical encounters with the legacy of what had come to be known as ‘theory,' and its contemporary supposedly post-human aftermath. There can be no redemptive post-human future in which the myopia and anthropocentrism of the species finds an exit and manages to emerge with ecology and life. At the same time, what has come to be known as the human - despite its normative intensity - can provide neither foundation nor critical lever in the Anthropocene epoch. Death of the PostHuman argues for a twenty-first century deconstruction of ecological and seemingly post-human futures.},

Each concept is explored in conjunction with specific films by Andy Warhol, Malcolm LeGrice, Lis Rhodes, Jean-Luc Goddard, Rose Lowder, Kurt Kren, and others. Peter Gidal draws on important politico-aesthetic writings, and uses some of his own previously published essays from Undercut, Screen, October, and Millennium Film Journal to undertake this concrete process of working through abstract concepts.

abstract = {The following report concerns the technical organization of the International Art Exhibition held last year from 28 April to 29 October at Expo 67 in Montreal, and includes a detailed description of the design and functions of the specially constructed museum building. While this exhibition was perhaps the most elaborate yet held at a world fair, the author and his colleagues acquired useful facts and experiences which should be of interest to those members of the museum profession responsible for the organization of international travelling art exhibitions. To some extent there are object lessons to be learnt by smaller institutions operating on more limited budgets. The exhibition was, as is generally acknowledged, a great success, attended by 1,529,392 persons, with an average daily attendance of 8,500. The organization of such an exhibition, which had its beginnings in 1964, involved, of necessity, numerous individuals and specialists both in the National Gallery of Canada, Ottawa, and the Canadian Corporation for the World Exhibition (known otherwise as Expo 67), together with the eminent personalities who formed the International Fine Arts Advisory Committee, and also required the co‐operation of architects and engineers. The full list of persons involved at all stages, including the list of lenders, is given in the catalogue of the exhibition. It is appropriate here to acknowledge in particular the efforts of Mr. Pierre Dupuy, Commissioner‐General of Expo 67, who took a special interest in the professional excellence of all technical arrangements; the late Donald W. Buchanan, Secretary of the International Fine Arts Advisory Committee, who from the very first planning meetings emphasised the importance of adequate technical standards in respect of the preservation, handling, transportation, and housing of the exhibition; Miss Jean Sutherland Boggs, Director of the National Gallery of Canada, Ottawa, who, through the Board of Trustees, authorised the seconding of the necessary staff to administer and operate the exhibition and museum in Montreal; members of my staff in the National Conservation Research Laboratory of the National Gallery of Canada—Messrs. M. Ruggles, U. Dix, J. Halmy (resident conservator at Expo 67), J. MacG. Grant and Miss Y. B. Gravelle; Mr. D. DeCoste, and members of his handling and packing staff; and Mr. E. Kerr, and members of his photographic unit. Acknowledgement is also due to the resident executive staff of the exhibition, Miss Kathleen Fenwick being director, and Mr. Gyde V. Shepherd; deputy director, who kept the exhibition running smoothly under very challenging conditions. My own official function throughout was as director of conservation and technical consultant to the International Fine Arts Advisory Committee. This involved frequent travel between Ottawa and Montreal. 1968 UNESCO},

La blasfemia requiere que una se tome las cosas muy en serio y, para m{\'{i}}, es el mejor referente que puedo adoptar desde las seculares tradiciones religiosas y evang{\'{e}}licas de la pol{\'{i}}tica norteamericana -incluido el feminismo socialista-. Por eso, este trabajo es mucho m{\'{a}}s aut{\'{e}}ntico que si surgiese como mito e identificaci{\'{o}}n. La blasfemia nos protege de la mayor{\'{i}}a moral interna y, al mismo tiempo, insiste en la necesidad comunitaria. La blasfemia no es apostas{\'{i}}a. La iron{\'{i}}a se ocupa de las contradicciones que, incluso dial{\'{e}}cticamente, no dan lugar a totalidades mayores, y que surgen de la tensi{\'{o}}n inherente a mantener juntas cosas incompatibles, consideradas necesarias y verdaderas. La iron{\'{i}}a trata del humor y de la seriedad. Es tambi{\'{e}}n una estrategia ret{\'{o}}rica y un m{\'{e}}todo pol{\'{i}}tico para el que yo pido m{\'{a}}s respeto dentro del feminismo socialista. En el centro de mi ir{\'{o}}nica fe, mi blasfemia es la imagen del ciborg. Un ciborg es un organismo cibern{\'{e}}tico, un h{\'{i}}brido de m{\'{a}}quina y organismo, una criatura de realidad social y tambi{\'{e}}n de ficci{\'{o}}n. La realidad social son nuestras relaciones sociales vividas, nuestra construcci{\'{o}}n pol{\'{i}}tica m{\'{a}}s importante, un mundo cambiante de ficci{\'{o}}n. Los movimientos internacionales feministas han construido la 'experiencia de las mujeres' y, asimismo, han destapado o descubierto este objeto colectivo crucial. Tal experiencia es una ficci{\'{o}}n y un hecho pol{\'{i}}tico de gran importancia. La liberaci{\'{o}}n se basa en la construcci{\'{o}}n de la conciencia, de la comprensi{\'{o}}n imaginativa de la opresi{\'{o}}n y, tambi{\'{e}}n, de lo posible. El ciborg es materia de ficci{\'{o}}n y experiencia viva que cambia lo que importa como experiencia de las mujeres a finales de este siglo. Se trata de una lucha a muerte, pero las fronteras entre ciencia ficci{\'{o}}n y realidad social son una ilusi{\'{o}}n {\'{o}}ptica.},

@article{Gavanas2011,
abstract = {"Pink Noises" brings together twenty-four interviews with women sound artists and electronic musicians, including club and radio DJs, re-mixers, composers, improvisers, instrument builders, and performance artists. The collection is an extension of website named Pinknoises, the critically-acclaimed website founded by musician and scholar Tara Rodgers in 2000 to promote women in electronic music and make information about music technologies more accessible to women and girls. That site featured interviews that Rodgers conducted with women artists, exploring their personal histories, creative methods, and role of gender in their work. This book offers new and lengthier interviews, a critical introduction, and resources for further research and technological engagement. Contemporary electronic music practices are illuminated through the stories of women artists of different generations and cultural backgrounds. They include the creators of ambient soundscapes, 'performance novels', sound sculptures, and software for digital audio, the developer of the Deep Listening philosophy, and the founders of the Liquid Sound Lounge radio show and the monthly Basement Bhangra parties in New York. These and many other artists open up about topics such as their conflicted relationships to formal music training, mainstream media representations of women in electronic music scenes, and the role of social networking in their careers. They discuss using sound to work creatively with structures of time and space, and voice and language; challenge distinctions of nature and culture; question norms of technological practice; and, balance their needs for productive solitude with collaboration and community. Whether designing and building modular synthesizers with analogue circuits or performing wearing a BodySynth that translates muscle movements into electronic sound, these artists expand notions of who and what counts in matters of invention, production, and noise-making.},

abstract = {Recordemos la conocida frase de Joseph Beuys: "Todo ser humano es un artista". Esta m{\'{a}}xima tiene una larga tradici{\'{o}}n que se remonta al marxismo temprano y a la vanguardia rusa. Lo que se entend{\'{i}}a en ese momento como utop{\'{i}}a se ha convertido hoy en una obligaci{\'{o}}n: todo ser humano tiene que asumir una responsabilidad est{\'{e}}tica por su apariencia frente al mundo, por el dise{\~{n}}o de s{\'{i}}. Aunque no todos producen obras, todos son una obra. A fines del siglo XX, el arte entr{\'{o}} en una nueva era: la de la producci{\'{o}}n art{\'{i}}stica masiva. Mientras que el anterior fue un per{\'{i}}odo signado por el consumo masivo del arte, en nuestra {\'{e}}poca la situaci{\'{o}}n se modific{\'{o}} al comp{\'{a}}s de los avances t{\'{e}}cnicos y de los cambios en los criterios que utilizamos para identificar qu{\'{e}} es arte y qu{\'{e}} no lo es. El acceso relativamente f{\'{a}}cil a variados dispositivos para la producci{\'{o}}n de im{\'{a}}genes combinado con Internet como plataforma de distribuci{\'{o}}n global alter{\'{o}} la relaci{\'{o}}n tradicional entre productores y espectadores: las redes sociales y los sitios como Facebook, Twitter, YouTube y Second Life ofrecen a la poblaci{\'{o}}n global la oportunidad de mostrar sus fotos, videos y textos de un modo que no puede distinguirse de cualquier otra obra de arte conceptualista o post-conceptualista. Asistimos a la sustituci{\'{o}}n del campo unificado de la cultura de masas por un escenario de fragmentaci{\'{o}}n en el que millones de prnductores generan textos e im{\'{a}}genes para un espectador que no tiene suficiente tiempo -para leer y ver. En los ensayos que componen Volverse p{\'{u}}blico, Boris Groys describe diversos aspectos de esta transformaci{\'{o}}n radical del campo del arte, desde sus manifestaciones embrionarias en los proyectos de artistas de vanguardia como Duchamp, Kandinsky y Malevich hasta la actualidad, en la que la actividad art{\'{i}}stica pareciera no ser m{\'{a}}s un destino exclusivo sino un gesto d{\'{e}}bil, una tarea que asumimos cotidianamente en el nuevo {\'{a}}gora medi{\'{a}}tica.},

Editor Gabrielle Jennings-a video artist herself-reveals as never before how works of abstract video are not merely, as the renowned curator Kirk Varnedoe once put it, “pictures of nothing,” but rather amorphous, ungovernable spaces that encourage contemplation and innovation. In explorations of the work of celebrated artists such as Jeremy Blake, Mona Hatoum, Pierre Huyghe, Ryoji Ikeda, Takeshi Murata, Diana Thater, and Jennifer West, alongside emerging artists, this volume presents fresh and vigorous perspectives on a burgeoning and ever-changing arena of contemporary art.},

@article{Lawrence2009,
abstract = {From 1966 to1976, science fiction films tended to depict civilizations of the future that had become intrinsically antagonistic to their inhabitants as a result of some internal or external cataclysm. This dystopian turn in science fiction films, following a similar move in science fiction literature, reflected concerns about social and ecological changes occurring during the late 1960s and early 1970s and their future implications. In these films, “dystopian” conditions are indicated as such by music incorporating distinctly modernist sounds and techniques reminiscent of twentieth- century concert works that abandon the common practice. In contrast, music associated with the protagonists is generally more accessible, often using common practiceharmonies and traditional instrumentation. These films appeared during a period referred to as the “New Hollywood,” which saw younger American filmmakers responding to developments in European cinema, notably the French New Wave. New Hollywood filmmakers treated their films as cinematic “statements” reflecting the filmmaker's artistic vision. Often, this encouraged an idiosyncratic use of music to enhance the perceived artistic nature of their films. This study examines the scores of ten science fiction films produced between 1966 and 1976: Fahrenheit 451, Planet of the Apes, 2001: A Space Odyssey, THX-1138, A Clockwork Orange, Silent Running, Soylent Green, Zardoz, Rollerball, and Logan's Run. Each is set in a dystopian environment of the future and each reflects the New Hollywood's aspirations to artistic seriousness and social relevance. The music accompanying these films connoted an image of technological and human progress at odds with the critical notions informing similar music for the concert hall. These film scores emphasized the extrapolated consequences of developments occurring during the 1950s and 1960s that social activists, science fiction writers, and even filmmakers regarded as worrisome trends. Filmmakers drew on the popular perceptions of these musical sounds to reinforce pessimistic visions of the future, thereby imbuing these sounds with new meanings for listeners of the contemporaneous present.},

abstract = {The cinema of Lucrecia Martel provides a comprehensive analysis of the work of the acclaimed Argentine director, whose elusive and elliptical feature films have garnered worldwide recognition since her 2001 debut La ci{\'{e}}naga. The book situates Martel's features and unstudied short films in relation to trends in recent national and international filmmaking. This volume considers existing critical work on Martel's oeuvre, and proposes new ways of understanding it, in particular through desire, the use of the child's perspective, and through the senses and perception. Martin also offers an analysis of the politics of Martel's films, showing how they can be understood as sites of transformation and possibility, develops queer approaches to Martel's films, and shows how they offer new forms of cinematic pleasure. The cinema of Lucrecia Martel combines traditional plot and gaze analysis with an understanding of film as a material object, to explore the films' sensory experiments and their challenges to dominant cinematic forms.},

abstract = {Primera Parte EL TEATRO MORTAL Puedo tomar cualquier espacio vac{\'{i}}o y llamarlo un escenario desnudo. Un hombre camina por este espacio vac{\'{i}}o mientras otro le observa, y esto es todo lo que se necesita para realizar un acto teatral. Sin embargo, cuando hablamos de teatro no queremos decir exactamente eso. Telones rojos, focos, verso libre, risa, oscuridad, se superponen confusamente en una desordenada imagen que se expresa con una palabra {\'{u}}til para muchas cosas. Decimos que el cine mata al teatro, y con esta frase nos referimos al teatro tal como era cuando naci{\'{o}} el cine, un teatro de taquilla, sal{\'{o}}n de descanso, asientos con bisagra para permitir libremente el paso del p{\'{u}}blico, candi-lejas, cambios de decorado, entreactos, m{\'{u}}sica, como si el teatro friera por propia definici{\'{o}}n esto y poco m{\'{a}}s. Intentar{\'{e}} descomponer la palabra en cuatro acepciones para distinguir cuatro significados diferentes, y as{\'{i}} hablar{\'{e}} de un teatro mortal, de un teatro sagrado, de un teatro tosco y de un teatro inmediato. A veces estos cuatro tipos de teatro coexisten, uno al lado del otro, en el West End de Londres o en Nueva York friera de Times Square. Otras veces se encuentran separados por centenares de kil{\'{o}}metros, el teatro sagrado en Varsovia y el tosco en Praga, y en ocasiones son metaf{\'{o}}ricos: dos de ellos se mezclan durante una noche, durante un acto. A veces, tambi{\'{e}}n, los cuatro se entremezclan en un solo momento. A primera vista el teatro mortal puede darse por sentado, ya que significa mal teatro. Como {\'{e}}sta es la forma de teatro que vemos con m{\'{a}}s frecuencia; y como est{\'{a}} estrechamente ligada al despreciado y muy atacado teatro comercial, pudiera parecer una p{\'{e}}rdida de tiempo extenderse en la cr{\'{i}}tica. No obstante, s{\'{o}}lo nos percataremos de la amplitud del problema si comprendemos quejo mortal es enga{\~{n}}oso y puede aparecer en cualquier lugar. Al menos, la condici{\'{o}}n de teatro mortal es bastante clara. El p{\'{u}}blico que asiste al teatro decrece en todo el mundo. De vez en cuando surgen nuevos movimientos, buenos escritores, etc., pero en general el teatro no s{\'{o}}lo no consigue inspirar o instruir, sino que apenas divierte. Con frecuencia, y debido a que su arte es impuro, se ha calificado de prostituta al teatro, pero en la actualidad dicho calificativo es cierto en otro sentido: las prostitutas cobran y luego abrevian el placer. La crisis de Broadway, la de Par{\'{i}}s y la del West End son la misma: no es necesario que los empresarios nos digan que el teatro es mal negocio, ya que incluso el p{\'{u}}blico lo advierte. Lo cierto es que si el p{\'{u}}blico exigiera el verdadero entretenimiento del que tanto habla, casi todos nos hallar{\'{i}}amos en el aprieto de saber por d{\'{o}}nde empezar. No existe un aut{\'{e}}ntico teatro de diversi{\'{o}}n, y no s{\'{o}}lo es la obra trivial o la mala comedia musical la que resulta incapaz de compensarnos el valor del dinero gastado, sino que el teatro mortal se abre 2 camino en la gran {\'{o}}pera y en la tragedia, en las obras de Moliere y en las piezas de Brecht. Y desde luego, este tipo de teatro en ning{\'{u}}n sitio se instala tan segura, c{\'{o}}moda v astutamente como en las obras de William Shakespeare. El teatro mortal se apodera f{\'{a}}cilmente de Shakespeare. Sus obras las interpretan buenos actores en forma que parece la adecuada; tienen un aire vivo y lleno de colorido, hay m{\'{u}}sica y todo el mundo viste de manera apropiada, tal como se supone que ha de vestirse en el mejor de los teatros cl{\'{a}}sicos. Sin embargo, en secreto, lo encontramos extremadamente aburrido, y en nuestro interior culpamos a Shakespeare, o a este tipo de teatro, incluso a nosotros mismos. Para empeorar las cosas siempre hay un espectador «mor-tal» que, por razones especiales, gusta de una falta de intensidad e incluso de distracci{\'{o}}n, tal como el erudito que emerge sonriendo de las interpretaciones ruti-narias de los cl{\'{a}}sicos, ya que nada le ha impedido probar y confirmarse sus queridas teor{\'{i}}as mientras recita los versos favoritos en voz baja. En su interior desea sinceramente un teatro que sea m{\'{a}}s noble que la vida y confunde una especie de satisfacci{\'{o}}n intelectual con la verdadera experiencia que anhela. Por desgracia, con-cede {\'{e}}l peso de su autoridad a lo mon{\'{o}}tono y de esta manera el teatro mortal prosigue su camino. Cualquiera que est{\'{e}} al tanto de los {\'{e}}xitos que se producen cada a{\~{n}}o, observar{\'{a}} un fen{\'{o}}meno muy curioso. Se espera que el llamado {\'{e}}xito sea m{\'{a}}s vivo, ligero y brillante que el fracaso, pero no siempre se da ese caso. Casi todas las temporadas, en la mayor{\'{i}}a de las ciudades amantes del teatro, se produce un gran {\'{e}}xito que desaf{\'{i}}a estas reglas: una obra que triunfa no a pesar sino debido a su monoton{\'{i}}a. Despu{\'{e}}s de todo, uno asocia la cultura con un cierto sentido del deber, as{\'{i}} como los trajes de {\'{e}}poca y los largos discursos con la sensaci{\'{o}}n de aburrimiento; por lo tanto, y a la inversa, un adecuado grado de aburrimiento supone una tranquilizadora garant{\'{i}}a de acontecimiento digno de m{\'{e}}rito. Naturalmente, la dosificaci{\'{o}}n es tan sutil que resulta imposible establecer la f{\'{o}}rmula exacta: si es excesiva, el p{\'{u}}blico se marcha; si resulta insuficiente, puede encontrar el tema desagradablemente intenso. Sin embargo, los autores mediocres parecen hallar de manera infalible la mezcla perfecta, y as{\'{i}} perpet{\'{u}}an el teatro mortal con insulsos {\'{e}}xitos, universalmente elogiados. El p{\'{u}}blico busca en el teatro algo que pueda calificar como «mejor» que la vida y por dicha raz{\'{o}}n est{\'{a}} predispuesto a confundir la cultura, o los adornos de la cultura, con algo que no conoce aunque oscuramente siente que podr{\'{i}}a existir, y as{\'{i}}, tr{\'{a}}gicamente, al convertir algo malo en {\'{e}}xito lo {\'{u}}nico que hace es enga{\~{n}}arse. Puesto que hablamos de teatro mortal, hagamos notar que la diferencia entre vida y muerte, de claridad cristalina en el hombre, queda de alg{\'{u}}n modo velada en otros campos. Un m{\'{e}}dico distingue en seguida entre el vestigio de vida y el in{\'{u}}til saco de huesos que la vida deja; pero tenemos menos experiencia en observar c{\'{o}}mo una idea, una actitud o una forma pueden pasar de lo vivo a lo moribundo. Esto, que resulta dif{\'{i}}cil de definir, es capaz de advertirlo sin embargo un ni{\~{n}}o. Pondr{\'{e}} un ejemplo. En Francia hay dos maneras mortales de interpretar una tragedia cl{\'{a}}sica. Una, tradicional, requiere voz y ademanes especiales, noble aspecto y un exaltado y musical modo de expresarse. La otra no es m{\'{a}}s que una fr{\'{i}}a versi{\'{o}}n de la anterior. Los gestos imperiales y los valores reales est{\'{a}}n desapareciendo r{\'{a}}pidamente de la vida cotidiana, de ah{\'{i}} que cada nueva generaci{\'{o}}n considere los ademanes grandiosos como algo cada vez m{\'{a}}s vac{\'{i}}o y carente de sentido. Esto lleva al actor joven a una furiosa e impaciente b{\'{u}}squeda de lo que {\'{e}}l llama verdad. Desea interpretar el verso},

Observations in the 1980s from sounding rockets and limited duration orbital spacecraft began to show the potential of this field and led to the deployment of two spacecraft devoted to EUV astronomy: the UK Wide Field Camera and the Extreme Ultraviolet Explorer. The instrumentation in these missions, although quite limited in comparison with instrumentation in other fields of space astronomy, provided unique and far-reaching results. These included new information on solar system topics, stellar chromospheres and corona, white dwarf astrophysics, cataclysmic variables, the interstellar medium, galaxies, and clusters of galaxies. We summarize these findings herein.},

abstract = {The Audible Past explores the cultural origins of sound reproduction. It describes a distinctive sound culture that gave birth to the sound recording and transmission devices so ubiquitous in modern life. With an ear for the unexpected, scholar and musician Jonathan Sterne uses the technological and cultural precursors of telephony, phonography, and radio as an entry point into a history of sound in its own right. Sterne studies the constantly shifting boundary between phenomena organized as "sound" and "not sound." In The Audible Past, this history crisscrosses the liminal regions between bodies and machines, originals and copies, nature and culture, and life and death. Blending cultural studies and the history of communication technology, Sterne follows modern sound technologies back through a historical labyrinth. Along the way, he encounters capitalists and inventors, musicians and philosophers, embalmers and grave-robbers, doctors and patients, Deaf children and their teachers, professionals and hobbyists, folklorists and tribal singers. The Audible Past tracks the connections between the history of sound and the defining features of modernity: from developments in medicine, physics, and philosophy to the tumultuous shifts of industrial capitalism, colonialism, urbanization, modern technology, and the rise of a new middle class. A provocative history of sound, The Audible Past challenges theoretical commonplaces such as the philosophical privilege of the speaking subject, the visual bias in theories of modernity, and static descriptions of nature. It will interest those in cultural studies, media and communication studies, the new musicology, and the history of technology.},

abstract = {This thesis presents a body of practical and theoretical work, which interprets sound art as a means of encouraging aural awareness in an everyday context. Through a methodological feedback loop of artistic practice and theoretical reflection, strategies for the aestheticisation of everyday aural experience have been developed and situated within a wider context of contemporary aural culture. The current state of this culture is critically examined. The widespread claim that we live in a deeply visualised culture is questioned. It is argued that contemporary Western society can also be characterised in terms of an increasing interest in auditory perception, which the development of sound art as an artistic discipline is one symptom of. The technological mediation of listening is discussed and characterised in terms of a mobilisation and individuation of aural experience. An overview of different listening modes informs a discussion of six different perspectives on sound as a physical and perceptual phenomenon. Various listening practices, which have been proposed in the field of sound art, are presented. It is argued that the development of sound art as an artistic discipline can be characterised in terms of an interest in the everyday as a source of sound material on one, and as an environment for aestheticised listening on the other hand. Sound art is proposed as a means of auralising the rhythms inherent to everyday life, and subtlety is identified as an aesthetic category for doing so. It is investigated how technological mediation can be applied to the aestheticisation of mobile and social listening experiences. The above issues have been addressed by means of artistic practice. The results of this process are presented as a portfolio of eight artworks, including sound installations, public interventions, site-specific electroacoustic pieces, graphical scores and mobile hardware projects.},

abstract = {The performance of electronic-music shows a large number of different practices, some displaying cunning interfaces that minutely track physical motions, while others refuse the display of any performative actions on behalf of the performer. With today's availability of largely inexpensive interfaces, the choice of a particular performance practice does not come as a technological necessity but as an aesthetic decision. This paper proposes a method to aesthetically evaluate the different performance practices that have emerged in the past decades in electronic music. Thereby the goal is to get a better understanding of the differing concepts of performance in electronic music. Since a fixed typology of performance practices proved not to be a suitable approach, a description of the practices by means of a parametric space is proposed. After the introduction of the various parameters, the application of the parametric space is demonstrated with five different examples. Copyright:},

All tones were 250 msec in duration and separated by 250-msec pauses. On any given stimulus presentation, most Ss reported the sequence of pitches delivered to one ear and ignored the other. They further tended significantly to report the sequence delivered to the right ear rather than to the left. However, each tone appeared to be localized in the ear receiving the higher frequency, regardless of which ear was followed for pitch and regardless of whether the higher or lower frequency was in fact perceived.

abstract = {The octave illusion (D. Deutsch, 1974) occurs when 2 tones separated by an octave are alternated repeatedly, such that when the right ear receives the high tone, the left ear receives the low tone, and vice versa. Most subjects in the original study reported hearing a single tone that alternated from ear to ear, whose pitch also alternated from octave to octave, and D. Deutsch (1975a) proposed an explanation in terms of separate what and where auditory pathways. C. D. Chambers, J. B. Mattingley, and S. A. Moss (2002) argued that the perceived pitch difference generally corresponds more to a semitone and proposed an alternative explanation in terms of diplacusis. This article argues that Chambers et al. used problematic procedures and reports a new experiment on the octave illusion, The findings confirm that an octave difference is generally perceived, and they agree with the model of Deutsch (1975a) but are at variance with the diplacusis hypothesis.},

abstract = {A systematic historical survey of Chinese thought is followed by an investigation of the historical-metaphysical questions of modern technology, asking how Chinese thought might contribute to a renewed questioning of globalized technics. Heidegger's critique of modern technology and its relation to metaphysics has been widely accepted in the East. Yet the conception that there is only one—originally Greek—type of technics has been an obstacle to any original critical thinking of technology in modern Chinese thought.Yuk Hui argues for the urgency of imagining a specifically Chinese philosophy of technology capable of responding to Heidegger's challenge, while problematizing the affirmation of technics and technologies as anthropologically universal.This investigation of the historical-metaphysical question of technology, drawing on Lyotard, Simondon, and Stiegler, and introducing a history of modern Eastern philosophical thinking largely unknown to Western readers, including philosophers such as Feng Youlan, Mou Zongsan, and Keiji Nishitani, sheds new light on the obscurity of the question of technology in China. Why was technics never thematized in Chinese thought? Why has time never been a real question for Chinese philosophy? How was the traditional concept of Qi transformed in its relation to Dao as China welcomed technological modernity and westernization?In The Question Concerning Technology in China, a systematic historical survey of the major concepts of traditional Chinese thinking is followed by a startlingly original investigation of these questions, in order to ask how Chinese thought might today contribute to a renewed, cosmotechnical questioning of globalized technics.},

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21% with default Glide SP settings to 58% with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63% success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40% of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

The fear that we're not good enough or that we don't know enough results in untold numbers of creative crises and potential masterpieces that never get realized. Electronic musicians used to be able to hide behind clunky, emerging technology as an excuse for inaction. But musicians today live in a golden age of tools and technology. A ninety-nine-cent smartphone app can give you the functionality of a million-dollar recording studio. A new song can be shared with the world as soon as it's finished. Tutorials for every sound design or music production technique can be found through a Google search. All of these developments have served to level the playing field for musicians, making it possible for a bedroom producer to create music at a level that used to be possible only for major-label artists. But despite all of this, making music is still hard. Why? Making Music was written both to answer this question and to offer ways to make it easier. It presents a systematic, concrete set of patterns that you can use when making music in order to move forward. It will teach you how to make music using technology, with a specific emphasis on solving musical problems, making progress, and (most importantly) finishing what you start.},

Los intercambios metab{\'{o}}licos se detendr{\'{i}}an. El coraz{\'{o}}n latir{\'{i}}a a un ritmo inmutable. Sin otras opciones que mantenerse as{\'{i}} para siempre o parar, en cualquier momento sufrir{\'{i}}a una parada. Las redes de neuronas ser{\'{i}}an incapaces de superar los estados de sincronizaci{\'{o}}n excesiva y se bloquear{\'{i}}an : dar{\'{i}}an paso a crisis epil{\'{e}}pticas; tal vez al autismo. Las patolog{\'{i}}as y sus s{\'{i}}ntomas, m{\'{a}}s que manifestaciones del caos, lo son de disfunciones de su gesti{\'{o}}n. Nunca ha sido r{\'{i}}tmicamente estable ni previsible el canto de insectos y batracios. Menos a{\'{u}}n el de las aves, por no hablar de los mam{\'{i}}feros. El caos y la complejidad est{\'{a}}n por todas partes. Sin ellos, la sensaci{\'{o}}n sonora r{\'{a}}pidamente devendr{\'{i}}a un silbido infinito e inmutable. Muchos han experimentado alguna vez un silbido, a veces acompa{\~{n}}ado de una p{\'{e}}rdida transitoria de capacidad auditiva. En la mayor parte de casos, el o{\'{i}}do se recupera al cabo de unos segundos, a veces, minutos. Es la forma benigna de estas sensaciones. Otras tienen el poder de alterar profundamente la vida la vida de quienes las experimentan. Aparecen de muchas maneras y por causas muy diversas : tras un episodio traum{\'{a}}tico, una enfermedad o un concierto donde el sonido era demasiado fuerte, pero no siempre existen antecedentes claros. Si no son alucinaciones, entonces los sonidos fantasmas son ac{\'{u}}fenos. Hay una diferencia importante : los ac{\'{u}}fenos no tienen significado, las alucinaciones, s{\'{i}}. Entre unas y otros se halla el dominio borroso de los acoasmas, que no son palabras ni voces, sino sonidos, como crujidos, roces, pasos, truenos, ladridos, aullidos y otros objetos sonoros menos definibles y en el lindar de la significaci{\'{o}}n. Ac{\'{u}}feno es un neologismo que a un tiempo viene de ἀ $\kappa$ού$\omega$ (akou, ra{\'{i}}z de o{\'{i}}r) i de $\phi$$\alpha$ί$\nu$$\omega$ (phaino, ra{\'{i}}z de aparecer). Empleado por primera vez en los a{\~{n}}os cuarenta del siglo XX para designar las sensaciones sonoras experimentadas en ausencia de est{\'{i}}mulos externos, el t{\'{e}}rmino apunta a fen{\'{o}}menos auditivos aberrantes o eventos extraordinarios consistentes en percepciones sonoras internas que, a pesar de no tener sentido real, ocupan involuntariamente la consciencia. Los romanos llamaban a esta molestia tinnitus (de t{\'{i}}nnere, timbrar, dar color a la voz, ta{\~{n}}er la campana). La palabra aparece en los textos de Plinio el Viejo para hacer referencia a esta sensaci{\'{o}}n y la literatura cient{\'{i}}fica anglosajona la adopta pasada la primera mitad del siglo XX. Ac{\'{u}}feno y tinnitus dan nombre a la misma experiencia. Los afectados sienten susurros, silbidos, tic-tacs, explosiones, pitidos, chirridos, vibraciones graves, campanas, campanillas y a{\'{u}}n otras formas sonoras de precisi{\'{o}}n m{\'{a}}s dif{\'{i}}cil. Cuando no existe una forma natural o artificial por la que el sonido en cuesti{\'{o}}n no puede ser experimentado por otras personas, entonces se trata de ac{\'{u}}fenos neurosensoriales. Son los m{\'{a}}s corrientes, pero tambi{\'{e}}n los m{\'{a}}s preocupantes e insidiosos, dado que las causas no son evidentes, especialmente para el entorno de quien los sufre. Derivan de disfunciones del sistema auditivo resultantes de hiperactividad an{\'{o}}mala y de reorganizaciones funcionales patol{\'{o}}gicas de estructuras o v{\'{i}}as auditivas. La g{\'{e}}nesis est{\'{a}} tanto en la mec{\'{a}}nica del aparato auditivo como en las v{\'{i}}as nerviosas que conducen las se{\~{n}}ales sonoras a la conciencia.

"But this is not solely a book about modern ideas in physics, for Barrow also considers and reflects on the philosophical and cultural consequences of a Theory of Everything, its implications for our own existence in the world, and its limits too - for it cannot encompass what lies beyond the mathematical laws, a world not only of physical constants, but of emotions and judgements, of music and art. Yet, Barrow argues, we should not give up in bewilderment: he shows how many insights and questions arise from the pursuit of a Theory of Everything, and what these may mean for our understanding of the cosmos and our own place in it."--BOOK JACKET.},

abstract = {The composition of music has evolved into an interactive process of directly sculpting sound morphologies on multiple time scales. A prime example is the electroacoustic music of Horacio Vaggione. This music's complexity and subtlety challenges mere textual description, posing formidable problems of discourse. This article traces the aesthetic and technical path followed by the composer during his career, and in so doing begins the task of developing a new analytical vocabulary. Fortunately, Professor Vaggione has written a considerable amount about his aesthetic approach. For this article, I have relied on Vaggione's texts as well as his extensive comments on a draft of this article.},

Concepts such as complexity, self-dis/organisation, emergence and chaos are crucial to these works, as are those of autonomy and synergy. Feedback, a mechanism that makes the subversion of technology possible, is the key for the design of these systems and for establishing a strict coupling between environment, performer, and machine. It will be shown that in such music systems ‘noise' can be the sole source of alimentation, and that sound affects itself, becoming a continuous perturbation for the spontaneous behaviour of such systems.},

The advent of computers has made possible the implementation of complex theoretical systems into audio-domain oriented applications, in some sense bridging the gap between theory and practice in the analog domain, and further increasing the range of audio/musical applications of feedback systems. In this paper, we first briefly introduce feedback systems; then, we propose a set of features to characterize them; finally we propose a typology targeted at feedback systems used in the audio/musical domain, and discuss some relevant examples.},

This family of groups will be considered in relationships with Anatol Vieru's theory of modes as it has been formalized and generalized to the rhythmic domain by the Romanian mathematician Dan Tudor Vuza. They represent the general framework where one can formalize the construction of a special family of tiling canons called the regular unending complementary canons of maximal category (RCMC-canons). This model has been implemented in IRCAM's visual programming language OpenMusic. Canons which are constructible through the Vuza's algorithm are called Vuza canons. The implementation of Vuza's model in OpenMusic enables to give the complete list of such canons and offers to composers an useful tool to manipulate complex global musical structures. The implementation shows many interesting mathematical properties of the compositional process which could be taken as a point of departure for a computational-oriented musicological discussion.},

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21% with default Glide SP settings to 58% with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63% success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40% of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

I propose to delineate the various shades of synchresis through a case study analysis of the somewhat simpler relations between light and sound in media installation works using luminosonic objects: objects which appear to emit both sound and light in an integrated manner. I will suggest a graphical framework for the analysis and composition of audiovisual relations between sound media and self-illuminating light objects, detailing various forms of integrated audiovisual dynamics. The framework will relate the compositional concepts of vertical harmonicity and horizontal counterpoint (Chion 1994) to the perceptual notion of “crossmodal binding” (Whitelaw 2008), thus linking compositional dynamics to perceptual effects and affects.},

To many Electroacoustic Composers, this new technology offered a multiplicity of creative possibilities, including the potential to advance public appreciation of electroacoustic music (EAM). The artistic merits of the new domain seemed to be supported by the scientific claim that “integrating visual and auditory stimuli serves the purpose of enhancing perceptual clarity1” However, nearly ten years later, expert opinion remains divided over the functionality of the language of EAM with moving images. The two opposing viewpoints, succinctly stated, are that adding moving images to electroacoustic music adds to its communicability, and that adding moving images to electroacoustic music subtracts from its communicability. This paper presents both arguments from the perspective of the composer-researcher. Research questions and hypotheses are raised through observations made in creative practice while functional aspects of language are examined using more traditional research methods such as literature review and listening tests. Results suggest that the language of EAM with moving images is governed by general principles of audiovisual attention, and that techniques of audiovisual composition may be categorised according to these principles.},

abstract = {In this series of lectures, delivered at Nanjing University from 2016 to 2019, Bernard Stiegler rethinks the so-called Anthropocene in relation to philosophy's failure to reckon with the manifold and indeed “cosmic” consequences of the entropic and thermodynamic revolution. Beginning with the Oxford Dictionaries' decision to make “post-truth” the 2016 word of the year, and taking this as an opportunity to understand the implications for Heidegger's “history of being”, “history of truth” and Gestell, the first series of lectures enter into an original consideration of the relationship between Socrates and Plato (and of tragic Greece in general) and its meaning for the history of Western philosophy. The following year's lecture series traverse a path from Foucault's biopower to psychopower to neuropower, and then to a critique of neuroeconomics. Revising Husserl's account of retention to focus on the irreducible connection between human memory and technological memory, the lectures culminate in reflections on the significance of neurotechnology in platform capitalism. The concept of hyper-matter is introduced in the lectures of 2019 as requisite for an epistemology that escapes the trap of opposing the material and the ideal in order to respond to the need for a new critique of the notion of information and technological performativity (of which Moore's law both is and is not an example) in an age when the biosphere has become a technosphere.},

abstract = {This thesis documents research in the field of sound diffusion for the live performance of electroacoustic music. Broad and inclusive ways of conceptualising electroacoustic music are presented, with the intention of promoting the design of improved sound diffusion systems in the future. Having defined ‘electroacoustic music' in terms of the technologies involved and the unique ways in which these creative frameworks are appropriated by practitioners (Chapter 1), a binary interpretation of the electroacoustic idiom, whereby musical philosophies can be regarded as either top-down or bottom-up, is given (Chapter 2). Discussion of the process of sound diffusion itself reveals two distinct performance praxes, which can also be characterised as top-down and bottom-up (Chapter 3). These differing ideologies, in addition to the technical demands of the electroacoustic idiom and the logistical demands of sound diffusion itself, must be accommodated by the sound diffusion system if live performances are to achieve the desired musical communication. It is argued that this is not presently the case. A system of criteria for the evaluation of sound diffusion systems is presented (Chapter 4). Two original concepts – the coherent audio source set (CASS) and coherent loudspeaker set (CLS) – are also presented; these are intended to be practically and theoretically useful in the field of sound diffusion. Several existing diffusion systems are evaluated in terms of these criteria (also Chapter 4). A description and evaluation of the M2 Sound Diffusion System, which was co-developed by the author as part of this research, is also given (Chapter 5). The final chapter describes ways in which superior future systems can be devised. These range from specific practical suggestions to general methodological recommendations. Overall, the intention is to provide an interpretation of the electroacoustic idiom that can be used as a heuristic tool in the design of new sound diffusion systems.},

abstract = {Resonances is a compelling collection of new essays by scholars, writers and musicians, all seeking to explore and enlighten this field of study. Noise seems to stand for a lack of aesthetic grace, to alienate or distract rather than enrapture. And yet the drones of psychedelia, the racket of garage rock and punk, the thudding of rave, the feedback of shoegaze and post-rock, the bombast of thrash and metal, the clatter of jungle and the stuttering of electronica, together with notable examples of avant-garde noise art, have all found a place in the history of contemporary musics, and are recognised as representing key evolutionary moments. Noise therefore is the untold story of contemporary popular music, and in a critical exploration of noise lies the possibility of a new narrative: one that is wide-ranging, connects the popular to the underground and avant-garde, fully posits the studio as a musical instrument, and demands new critical and theoretical paradigms of those seeking to write about music.},

abstract = {Sound can be deployed to produce discomfort, express a threat, or create an ambience of fear or dread--to produce a bad vibe. Sonic weapons of this sort include the "psychoacoustic correction" aimed at Panama strongman Manuel Noriega by the U.S. Army and at the Branch Davidians in Waco by the FBI, sonic booms (or "sound bombs") over the Gaza strip, and high frequency rat repellants used against teenagers in malls. At the same time, artists and musicians generate intense frequencies in the search for new aesthetic experiences and new ways of mobilizing bodies in rhythm. In Sonic Warfare, Steve Goodman explores these uses of acoustic force and how they affect populations. Most theoretical discussions of sound and music cultures in relationship to power, Goodman argues, have a missing dimension: the politics of frequency. Goodman supplies this by drawing a speculative diagram of sonic forces, investigating the deployment of sound systems in the modulation of affect. Traversing philosophy, science, fiction, aesthetics, and popular culture, he maps a (dis)continuum of vibrational force, encompassing police and military research into acoustic means of crowd control, the corporate deployment of sonic branding, and the intense sonic encounters of sound art and music culture. Goodman concludes with speculations on the not yet heard--the concept of unsound, which relates to both the peripheries of auditory perception and the unactualized nexus of rhythms and frequencies within audible bandwidths.},

The application of sound to other media (such as film or video) is well known and the idea of sound as a medium in its own right (such as radio) is also widely accepted. However, the idea that sound could also be a distinct art form by itself is less well established and often misunderstood. 'The fundamentals of sonic arts & sound design' introduces, describes and begins the process of defining this subject and to provide a starting point for anyone who has an interest in the creative uses of sound. The book explores the worlds of sonic arts and sound design through their history and development, and looks at the present state of these extraordinarily diverse genres through the works and words of established artists and through an examination of the wide range of practices that currently come under the heading of 'sonic arts'. The technologies that are used and the impact that they have upon the work are also discussed. Additionally, 'The fundamentals of sonic arts & sound design' considers new and radical approaches to sound recording, performance, installation works and exhibitions and visits the worlds of the sonic artist and the sound designer.},

abstract = {This dissertation examines key issues relating to minimal techno, a sub-genre of electronic dance music (EDM) that emerged in the early 1990s. These key issues are the aesthetics, composition, performance, and technology of minimal techno, as well as the economics of EDM production. The study aims to answer the following question. What is the musical and social significance of minimal techno production and performance?\n\n\nThe study is conducted in two parts. The history of minimal music is traced from Satie in the 1890s to Plastikman in the 1990s, a central contribution to minimal techno. Plastikman is a stage name for the subject of the first part, a case study of minimal techno artist Richie Hawtin. A chapter on Liine, a company I founded with partners including Richie Hawtin, describes the performance software we developed for his 2010-2011 Plastikman Live tour. A chapter on minimal techno performance methods examines the structure of the Ableton Live set created for Plastikman Live. A theory chapter, based on Jacques Attali?s Bruits (2001), studies the relationship between technology, money, power and techno music production on both an individual and\ncollective scale. The second part provides a detailed commentary on music I composed during the project in response to the theoretical issues raised. A final chapter discusses the overall thesis, and draws conclusions.\n\n\nMinimal techno, as it is practiced through Liine software, the Plastikman Live show, or through my own productions, is revealed to be a deeply improvisatory form of music. The relationship between body, mind and sound emerges as one of the major themes. Minimal techno production and performance can be seen as a reflection of the profoundly changing relationship between man and digital technology.},

abstract = {“The basic purpose of this project is to build an auto-conductive non-harmonic musical system with nine instrumental parts and/or a live electronics field. One of the main properties is dispensability: any of the parts may be omitted without damage in the macrostructure. As the absence of some parts as the combinatorial variability of them do not affect the musical efficacy of the composition. Such a system will be possible thanks to the observation of some compositional conductive models of the past (Flemish polyphony) and some more present, as Xenakis's stochastic music. Fundamentally, this task is made by means of ‘seeds', minimal elemental shapes, which create the macro and micro levels of the work. In the first level of the composition, the macroform level, the seeds are implemented in a computer-assisted composition environment using the AC Toolbox program, where a graphics-based grammar is set on a discourse that is drawn in a unique stochastic gesture and later deconstructed. In the second level of composition, the microform level, the seed's data are used as a controller of electronic gestures implemented in the Max/MSP program. The principal purpose of this level will be to enlarge the compositional domain and give an opportunity of extension to the physical possibilities of instruments, driving it towards the micro-sounds and other parallel temporal processes and having their own self-sufficient process inside the work”.},

Those models informed the design and implementation of several analytical systems. Frequently, research concerning the mechanisms of perceptual organization catches the attention of composers. Neither the idea of exploring those mechanisms, nor the urge to integrate analytical with compositional processes is something new. The case of analyzing streams of midi numbers arrived from keyboard-based instruments resides in bygone eras. Onset detection algorithms that operate directly on audio signals are by now common practice. We present implementations, encapsulated as max/MSP abstractions, as part of our own attempt to integrate analytical with compositional processes. However, the suggestion that analytical processes could be also suitable for composition, is under question.},

abstract = {With the introduction of the computer as a musical tool, the role of timbre in composition has been largely emphasized. Until today, many sound synthesis models have been introduced, each one oﬀering a diﬀerent representation for timbre. Nevertheless, current deﬁnition of timbre reveals our relatively poor understanding about what timbre is. When we try to extract timbral properties from an acoustic sound, this becomes crucial. The real-time timbre tracking model presented in this thesis tackles this diﬃcult issue. By following the essence of Timbre Space technique extensively used in the non real-time timbre recognition ﬁeld, the model tracks timbre of a monophonic acoustic instrument. Unlike conventional approaches, in this model, timbre is described by its similarity/dissimilarity. The model is fully implemented in the Max/MSP programming environment, and can be applied for digital instrument designs and in interactive computer music, providing another possibility of using acoustic instrumentalist's musical expressivity in computer music.},

abstract = {A program for synthesizing music and psychological stimuli on a digital computer is described. The sound is produced by three operations: (a) A compiler generates the programs for a set of instruments. (b) These instruments are “played” by a sequencing program at the command of a sequence of “note” cards which contain information analogous to that given by conventional music notes. (c) The computer output, in the form of numbers on a digital magnetic tape, is converted to audible sound by a digital‐to‐analog converter, a desampling filter, and a loudspeaker. By virtue of the general nature of the compiling program a great variety of instruments may be produced, and the instrument programs are quite efficient in terms of computer time. The “note” cards are arranged to minimize the effort necessary to specify a composition. Preliminary compositions indicate that exceedingly interesting music and useful psychological stimuli can be generated. {\textcopyright} 1961 The Bell System Technical Journal},

Each chapter starts with a theoretical description of one technique or problem area and ends with a series of working examples (over 100 in all), covering a wide range of applications. A unifying approach is taken throughout; chapter two, for example, treats both sampling and wavetable synthesis as special cases of one underlying technique. Although the theory is presented quantitatively, the mathematics used goes no further than trigonometry and complex numbers. The examples and supported software - along with a machine-readable version of the text - are available on the web and maintained by a large online community. The Theory and Techniques of Electronic Music is valuable both as a textbook and as professional reading for electronic musicians and computer music researchers.},

abstract = {El poder lo tiene el que domina los lenguajes. Sobre los lenguajes como reproducci{\'{o}}n, creaci{\'{o}}n y simulaci{\'{o}}n de la realidad. La situaci{\'{o}}n intelectual y cultural de nuestra {\'{e}}poca se considera generalmente pluralista, tolerante y permisiva. Seg{\'{u}}n esta opini{\'{o}}n ampliamente extendida la actual cultura occidental no ofrece al hombre criterios generales y vinculantes que le capacitar{\'{i}}an para escoger entre la multitud de ideolog{\'{i}}as, doctrinas, teor{\'{i}}as, proyectos pol{\'{i}}ticos o tendencias art{\'{i}}sticas, etc. que, conviviendo en una especie de "coexistencia pac{\'{i}}fica", se recelan mutuamente. Cada una de estas corrientes ideol{\'{o}}gicas suele reclamar su propia verdad {\'{u}}ltima. En un nivel te{\'{o}}rico, todas en el fondo se excluyen rec{\'{i}}procamente. Ya no existen criterios de selecci{\'{o}}n independientes de las teor{\'{i}}as. Por ello las decisiones se toman m{\'{a}}s o menos por casualidad o arbitrariamente. Pero este hecho descalifica a su vez las exigencias de verdad de todas las teor{\'{i}}as. Incluso niega de hecho la funci{\'{o}}n de la raz{\'{o}}n te{\'{o}}rica como algo fundamental Esta situaci{\'{o}}n se valora naturalmente de forma distinta: unos la saludan como expresi{\'{o}}n de la emancipaci{\'{o}}n, liberalidad y tolerancia, que, por motivos morales, es preferible a la exigencia exagerada de la raz{\'{o}}n. Desde un punto de vista religioso, esta calificaci{\'{o}}n incluso podr{\'{i}}a justificarse dentro del marco de una teolog{\'{i}}a negativa o apof{\'{a}}ntica, a saber, como reconocimiento de la limitaci{\'{o}}n ontol{\'{o}}gica de la raz{\'{o}}n humana, que por este motivo exige el respeto de la voluntad y la verdad ocultas de Dios. Otras lamentan, sin embargo, el pluralismo contempor{\'{a}}neo y ven en {\'{e}}l el dominio del cinismo y de la "tolerancia represiva", una perenne reiteraci{\'{o}}n absurda del statu quo, que no suministra orientaci{\'{o}}n para la actuaci{\'{o}}n del hombre y que, al contrario, le condena a lo facultativo y la arbitrariedad. La pol{\'{e}}mica entre las valoraciones positivas y negativas de la actual situaci{\'{o}}n domina ampliamente las discusiones intelectuales del momento. Pero debajo de esta pol{\'{e}}mica se oculta – como dec{\'{i}}amos – un consenso sobre el diagn{\'{o}}stico fundamental acerca de la configuraci{\'{o}}n de esta situaci{\'{o}}n. Existe consenso acerca de su condici{\'{o}}n pluralista y facultativa. Ahora bien, parece que precisamente esta caracterizaci{\'{o}}n sea cuestionable. Se opone a mis experiencias y mis observaciones en el trato con las empresas culturales modernas. Estas empresas – como cualquier empresa – obligan al rendimiento, al {\'{e}}xito, crean determinadas reglas y establecen determinados criterios seg{\'{u}}n los cuales se eval{\'{u}}a el rendimiento y el {\'{e}}xito. Sin duda el criterio m{\'{a}}s importante es la exigencia de originalidad. Cualquiera que pretenda triunfar en la vida cultural actual, en el {\'{a}}mbito que sea, tropieza con esta exigencia. Un artista s{\'{o}}lo es reconocido si demuestra que su obra es original, nueva, "creativa". Para el cient{\'{i}}fico es lo mismo. Tiene que establecer una teor{\'{i}}a original y personal, por lo nimia que sea, para poder ser alguien en el mundo de la ciencia. A los dise{\~{n}}adores de moda, los pol{\'{i}}ticos y otras v{\'{i}}ctimas de la exigencia de innovaci{\'{o}}n los respetar{\'{e}} por ahora en mi enumeraci{\'{o}}n. La exigencia de ser original e innovador es, sin embargo todo menos tolerante o permisiva. Precisamente no permite a los productores de cultura elegir entre las corrientes ideol{\'{o}}gicas y art{\'{i}}sticas existentes, sino que hasta excluye esta posibilidad. La obligaci{\'{o}}n de estar informado acerca de la oferta en el {\'{a}}mbito cultural no significa que el creador pueda escoger libremente lo que le parece, sino que debe evitar todo lo que pueda levantar la sospecha de que no es original. La pluralidad de las actitudes m{\'{e}}todos y teor{\'{i}}as culturales ofrecidas no es, por tanto, expresi{\'{o}}n de una},

abstract = {“Aquel que ve no sabe ver”: esta presuposici{\'{o}}n atraviesa nuestra historia, de la caverna plat{\'{o}}nica a la denuncia de la sociedad del espect{\'{a}}culo. Es com{\'{u}}n al fil{\'{o}}sofo que quiere que cada uno ocupe su lugar y a los revolucionarios que quieren arrancar a los dominados de las ilusiones que los mantienen en ese estado. Algunos emplean explicaciones sutiles o instalaciones espectaculares para mostrar a los ciegos lo que estos no ven. Otros quieren cortar el mal de ra{\'{i}}z, transformando el espect{\'{a}}culo en acci{\'{o}}n y al espectador en hombre que act{\'{u}}a. Los estudios reunidos aqu{\'{i}} oponen a esas dos estrategias una hip{\'{o}}tesis simple: el hecho de ver no implica ninguna debilidad; la transformaci{\'{o}}n en espectadores de quienes estaban destinados a las coacciones y a las jerarqu{\'{i}}as de la acci{\'{o}}n pudo contribuir a conmover las posiciones sociales, y la denuncia del hombre alienado por el exceso de im{\'{a}}genes fue de entrada la respuesta del orden dominante a ese desorden. La emancipaci{\'{o}}n del espectador es entonces la afirmaci{\'{o}}n de su capacidad de ver lo que {\'{e}}l ve y de saber qu{\'{e}} pensar y qu{\'{e}} hacer con ello. Al examinar algunas formas y debates del arte contempor{\'{a}}neo, este libro intenta responder a las preguntas: ¿qu{\'{e}} entender por arte pol{\'{i}}tico o pol{\'{i}}tica del arte? ¿C{\'{o}}mo nos situamos respecto a la tradici{\'{o}}n del arte cr{\'{i}}tico y del deseo de incluir el arte en la vida? ¿C{\'{o}}mo la cr{\'{i}}tica militante de la mercanc{\'{i}}a y de la imagen devino la afirmaci{\'{o}}n melanc{\'{o}}lica de su omnipotencia o la denuncia reaccionaria del “hombre democr{\'{a}}tico”?},

abstract = {Modern philosophers generally assume that music is a problem to which philosophy ought to offer an answer. Andrew Bowie's Music, Philosophy, and Modernity suggests, in contrast, that music might offer ways of responding to some central questions in modern philosophy. Bowie looks at key philosophical approaches to music ranging from Kant, through the German Romantics and Wagner, to Wittgenstein, Heidegger and Adorno. He uses music to re-examine many ideas about language, subjectivity, metaphysics, truth and ethics, and he suggests that music can show how the predominant images of language, communication, and meaning in contemporary philosophy may be lacking in essential ways. His book will be of interest to philosophers, musicologists, and all who are interested in the relation between music and philosophy.},

abstract = {Gilles Deleuze (1925–95) was Professor of Philosophy at the University of Vincennes in Saint-Denis from 1969 to 1987. He published extensively on the history of philosophy and on the concepts of the arts. His books include Empiricism and Subjectivity (1953; English trans. 1991), Proust and Signs (1964; English trans. 2000), Bergsonism (1966; English trans. 1988), Diff erence and Repetition (1968; English trans. 1994), Spinoza and the Problem of Expression (1968; English trans. 1988), Francis Bacon (1981; English trans. 2003), Cinema 1 (1983; English trans. 1986), Cinema 2 (1985; English trans. 1989); Foucault (1986; English trans. 1988) and The Fold (1988; English trans. 1993). In collaboration with the political psychoanalyst F{\'{e}}lix Guattari he co- authored a number of works, including Anti- Oedipus (1972; English trans. 1977), Kafka (1975; English trans. 1986), A Thousand Plateaus (1980; English trans. 1987) and What is Philosophy? (1991; English trans. 1994). Of all the film-philosophies of the twentieth century, it is perhaps Deleuze's that is most of the cinema. By that I mean that it attempts to belong to cinema rather than simply be about it. It shows us film thinking for itself. The magnanimity Deleuze shows to film's conceptual power is seen most clearly at the very end of his two-volume work on film (Cinema 1: The Movement-Image and Cinema 2: The Time-Image) when he writes that “cinema's concepts are not given in cinema. And yet they are cinema's concepts, not theories about cinema.”},

No two people have the same reaction to life circumstances. Hearing loss can induce observable psychological effects at various points in development. The potential psychological effects of hearing loss are different for children and adults, and an individual's personality affects adaptation to hearing loss and cochlear implants. In general, hearing loss makes interaction with the outside world difficult. Having a hearing loss has been described as an invisible handicap, especially in the social realm. In fact, Helen Keller once said that deafness cuts one off from people, whereas blindness cuts one off from things.

abstract = {In the formation of human memory models, the characteristics of nonverbal information storage have received very little attention. This may be attributed largely to the popularity of the three-stage view of memory as a framework for such models. This view holds that nonverbal information is retained in highly transitory and nonspecific fashion, and that it can be saved from obliteration only by a process of verbal labeling that enables it to enter a linguistic short-term memory store. If the nonverbal store were indeed simply an unstructured buffer that retains infor- mation before verbal encoding, the study of its characteristics would clearly be of little general interest. There is growing evidence, however, that this view is incorrect. This chapter reviews such evidence with regard to the duration of the nonverbal memory trace, and then describes a series of experiments exploring the behavior of one specific nonverbal memory system over time periods characteristic of short-term memory. These experiments demonstrate that with the use of simple stimulus materials, which may be precisely and systematically varied, the short-term stor- age of nonverbal information can be shown to possess a systematization and specificity rivaling any found in verbal memory studies.},

All Ss channeled this sequence by frequency range: No S channeled by ear of input, and none reported a full ascending or descending scale. Various illusory percepts were obtained, which varied in correlation with the handedness of the listener. Right-handers tended to perceive the upper tones of the dichotic sequence as emanating from the right earphone and the lower tones from the left, and to maintain this percept when the earphones were places in reverse position.

The subjects were required to tap with the right hand in synchrony with the train delivered to the right ear, and to tap with the left hand in synchrony with the train delivered to the left ear. Accuracy of performance in polyrhythm contexts was substantially lower than in simple rhythm contexts, and decreased with an increase in the complexity of the associated polyrhythm. It was concluded that the performer develops a representation of the pattern as an integrated whole, and that performance accuracy is inversely related to pattern complexity. {\textcopyright} 1983 Psychonomic Society, Inc.},

abstract = {The octave illusion is produced by a dichotic sequence of tones that alternate in frequency between 400 and 800 Hz, such that when the right ear receives 400 Hz the left ear receives 800 Hz; and vice versa. Most listeners obtain the illusion of a single high tone in one ear alternating with a single low tone in the other ear. Further, most right-handers hear the high tone on the right and low tone on the left. The present study examined localization patterns in this illusion as a function of handedness and also of familial handedness background. The effect of handedness was highly significant: the tendency to hear the high tone on the right and the low tone on the left was lower among mixed handers and left-handers than among right-handers. The effect of familial handedness background was also highly significant: the tendency to hear the high tone on the right and the low tone on the left was lower among those with a sinistral familial background than among those with a purely dextral familial background. These findings are discussed in relation to the hypothesis that perception of the illusion serves as a reflection of the direction of cerebral dominance in most individuals. {\textcopyright} 1983.},

abstract = {The octave illusion was first described by Diana Deutsch in 1974; in this phenomenon, a dichotic sequence of oscillating 400 and 800 Hz sinusoidal tones evokes different illusory percepts. At the same time, the obtained percepts were found to be dependent on the subjects' handedness. This study investigates the influence of the handedness classification method on the correlation between reported percept and handedness in the octave illusion. After presenting the stimulus, we asked a total of 174 subjects to report their percepts and complete a handedness inventory as well as a speed tapping task. According to the right shift theory of Annett (1972, 2002) and a related study by Kopiez, Galley, and Lehmann (2010), we hypothesized that the use of performance measurement to classify handedness may clarify ambiguous correlations of subjects' handedness with some obtained illusionary percepts. The results support the general findings of Deutsch but show that stronger effects can be found if hand performance differences are used for handedness classification. A better separation between the handedness groups could be observed, especially for the complex perception patterns. {\textcopyright} The Author(s) 2013.},

abstract = {Absolute pitch, the rare ability to identify or produce a musical tone without a reference tone, has been shown to be advantageous in some musical tasks; however, its relevance in musical contexts primarily involving relative pitch has been questioned. To explore this issue, 36 trained musicians-18 absolute pitch possessors and 18 non-possessors with equivalent age of onset and duration of musical training-were tested on interval naming tasks requiring only relative pitch. The intervals to be named were either ascending or descending with separation ranging from 1 to 12 semitones and equally involved all 12 pitch classes. Three different conditions were employed; these used brief sine waves, piano tones, and piano tones preceded by a V7-I chord cadence so as to establish a tonal context. The possession of absolute pitch was strongly correlated with enhanced performance on all these tests of relative pitch. Furthermore, no evidence was found that this absolute pitch avantage depended on key, interval size, or musical context.},

abstract = {Absolute pitch (AP), the ability to name a musical note in the absence of a reference note, is extremely rare in the U.S. and Europe, and its genesis is unclear. The prevalence of AP was examined among students in an American music conservatory as a function of age of onset of musical training, ethnicity, and fluency in speaking a tone language. Taking those of East Asian ethnicity, the performance level on a test of AP was significantly higher among those who spoke a tone language very fluently compared with those who spoke a tone language fairly fluently and also compared with those who were not fluent in speaking a tone language. The performance level of this last group did not differ significantly from that of Caucasian students who spoke only nontone language. Early onset of musical training was associated with enhanced performance, but this did not interact with the effect of language. Further analyses showed that the results could not be explained by country of early music education. The findings support the hypothesis that the acquisition of AP by tone language speakers involves the same process as occurs in the acquisition of a second tone language.},

abstract = {This paper reports a large-scale direct-test study of absolute pitch (AP) in students at the Shanghai Conservatory of Music. Overall note-naming scores were very high, with high scores correlating positively with early onset of musical training. Students who had begun training at age ≤5 yr scored 83% correct not allowing for semitone errors and 90% correct allowing for semitone errors. Performance levels were higher for white key pitches than for black key pitches. This effect was greater for orchestral performers than for pianists, indicating that it cannot be attributed to early training on the piano. Rather, accuracy in identifying notes of different names (C, C#, D, etc.) correlated with their frequency of occurrence in a large sample of music taken from the Western tonal repertoire. There was also an effect of pitch range, so that performance on tones in the two-octave range beginning on Middle C was higher than on tones in the octave below Middle C. In addition, semitone errors tended to be on the sharp side. The evidence also ran counter to the hypothesis, previously advanced by others, that the note A plays a special role in pitch identification judgments.},

This paper reports a substantial difference in the prevalence of absolute pitch in two normal populations, in a large-scale study employing an on-site test, without self-selection from within the target populations. Music conservatory students in the U.S. and China were tested. The Chinese subjects spoke the tone language Mandarin, in which pitch is involved in conveying the meaning of words. The American subjects were nontone language speakers. The earlier the age of onset of musical training, the greater the prevalence of absolute pitch; however, its prevalence was far greater among the Chinese than the U.S. students for each level of age of onset of musical training. The findings suggest that the potential for acquiring absolute pitch may be universal, and may be realized by enabling infants to associate pitches with verbal labels during the critical period for acquisition of features of their native language.},

abstract = {The formation of coherent percepts requires grouping together spatio-temporally disparate sensory inputs. Two major questions arise: (1) is awareness necessary for this process; and (2) can non-conscious elements of the sensory input be grouped into a conscious percept? To address this question, we tested two patients suffering from severe left auditory extinction following right hemisphere damage. In extinction, patients are unaware of the presence of left side stimuli when they are presented simultaneously with right side stimuli. We used the 'scale illusion' to test whether extinguished tones on the left can be incorporated into the content of conscious awareness. In the scale illusion, healthy listeners obtain the illusion of distinct melodies, which are the result of grouping of information from both ears into illusory auditory streams. We show that the two patients were susceptible to the scale illusion while being consciously unaware of the stimuli presented on their left. This suggests that awareness is not necessary for auditory grouping and non-conscious elements can be incorporated into a conscious percept. {\textcopyright} 2008 Deouell, Deutsch, Scabini, Soroker and Knight.},

abstract = {This chapter explores the relationship between music perception as it is studied in the laboratory and as it occurs in the real world. We first examine general principles by which listeners group musical tones into perceptual configurations, and how these principles are implemented in music composition and performance. We then show that, for certain types of configuration, the music as it is perceived can differ substantially from the music that is notated in the score, or as might be imagined from reading the score. Furthermore, there are striking differences between listeners in the perception of certain musical passages. Implications of these findings are discussed. First, we consider general principles of perceptual organization and show how they are applied to live musical situations. Second, we show that music as perceived can, for certain configurations, be quite different from that in the written score, or as might be imagined from reading a score. Instead, striking illusions can occur on listening to music, and there are strong differences between listeners in the way that some of these illusions are perceived. In some cases, such perceptual differences correlate with handedness, and so can be taken to reflect variations in innate brain organization. In the case of another illusion, perceptual differences correlate with the language or dialect to which the listener has been exposed, particularly in childhood, and point to an influence of exposure to extramusical phenomena on the perception of music.},

There are thousands of languages in the world which make use of pitch patterns to construct words much as vowels and consonants are used, among which Mandarin (a.k.a. Putonghua) is a typical tone language. This study examines the effect of language experience (tone language experience vs. nontone language experience) on non-linguistic pitch perception. First, we show a significantly higher prevalence of absolute pitch among native tone-language-speaking music students than among nontone-language-speaking music students. Moreover, we show that language experience shapes the perception of tone sweeps, extending the influence of language prototypes from the linguistic domain to the non-linguistic domain. Taken together, these results demonstrate that language experience affects auditory perception, and so provide evidence for the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis in the auditory modality.},

abstract = {The auditory octave illusion arises when dichotically presented tones, one octave apart, alternate rapidly between the ears. Most subjects perceive an illusory sequence of monaural tones: A high tone in the right ear (RE) alternates with a low tone, incorrectly localized to the left ear (LE). Behavioral studies suggest that the perceived pitch follows the RE input, and the perceived location the higher-frequency sound. To explore the link between the perceived pitches and brain-level interactions of dichotic tones, magnetoencephalographic responses were recorded to 4 binaural combinations of 2-min long continuous 400- and 800-Hz tones and to 4 monaural tones. Responses to LE and RE inputs were distinguished by frequency-tagging the ear-specific stimuli at different modulation frequencies. During dichotic presentation, ipsilateral LE tones elicited weaker and ipsilateral RE tones stronger responses than when both ears received the same tone. During the most paradoxical stimulus-high tone to LE and low tone to RE perceived as a low tone in LE during the illusion-also the contralateral responses to LE tones were diminished. The results demonstrate modified binaural interaction of dichotic tones one octave apart, suggesting that this interaction contributes to pitch perception during the octave illusion. ? 2012 Acoustical Society of America.},
